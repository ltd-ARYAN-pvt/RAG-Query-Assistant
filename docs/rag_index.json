        "content": "How to Deal with Spam Spam has increasingly become a problem on the Internet. While every Internet user receives some spam, email addresses posted to web sites or in newsgroups and chat rooms attract the most spam. To reduce the amount of spam you receive: Don't reply to spam Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used Be proactive Don't reply to spam If you reply to spam, the spammer or the automated program on the other end will then know that your address is connected to a live person, and the spammer will then bombard you with even more spam, and circulate your address to other spammers. It is critical that you pause and think before replying to any spam. Consider the following guidelines: Setting up your email account to generate automatic responses while you are away can have the unfortunate side-effect of verifying your email address to every spammer that sends you spam. If the message appears to come from a legitimate company, the company may have obtained your email address from some transaction between you and the company. In fact, you may have inadvertently provided your email address (e.g., if you didn't check a box marked Don't send me product updates). In these cases, it is usually safe to reply and ask to be removed from the mailing list. If it is not a company you recognize, use your judgment. To be safe, copy and paste the link to the company's site into the browser rather than clicking it in the email message. If the spam is clearly from a disreputable source, never respond. Do not follow the (probably bogus) unsubscribe directions. In most cases, if you never reply, the network of spammers will eventually decide your email address is a dud, and will stop using it as often. Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used Every time you communicate on the Internet or browse a web site, there are opportunities for spammers to intercept your communications to obtain your email address and other personal information. Otherwise reputable companies may sell or exchange your email address with other companies, and this information may eventually find its way to a spammer. At worst, spammers will use automated programs to bombard these lists of email addresses with spam. Consider the following guidelines: Subscribe only to essential discussion lists, and ensure that they are moderated. Think twice before offering your email address to a web site. You may wish to check the site's privacy policy first to be sure it uses secure technology, and that the company does not share your email address with others. If you need to list email addresses on your web site, present the addresses in a way that makes them less vulnerable to collection and abuse by spammers. Every time you are asked for your email address verbally or on paper, think carefully about whether or not you want to receive any information from that company or organization. It is usually best to decline to provide your email address. Whenever possible, advocate that organizations you are involved in or do business with default to the opt-in model. This requires you to specifically request to be added to their email lists, rather than the opt-out model, where they add you to email lists automatically, and then give you the option of asking to be removed. Be proactive Adjusting the security settings in your web browser is a good preventive measure. For a higher level of security, have your browser disallow: Accepting cookies Listing your name and other personal information in your browser profile Filling in form fields for you This will help reduce the amount of personal information transmitted to sites at the expense of full functionality, since many legitimate web sites require you to accept cookies. Do not contribute to the spam problem by producing any of it yourself! In particular, learn about chain mail and do not forward chain mail to others. Also, if you receive an email message that appears to warn of some horrible thing happening (a virus that reportedly deletes all your files, for example) or is a touching sob story (about helping to save a poor sick girl or boy, for example), be suspicious. Nearly every instance of chain mail is a hoax. The message may even come from someone you know and respect who is simply not aware that it's a hoax. Learn about hoaxes and the sites available to verify hoaxes, and do not forward them to others. Questions regarding X-rated spam (unsolicited mass e-mail) Some members of the Company have at times expressed concern to IT regarding their own accountability for unsolicited e-mail of a sexual nature sent to their Company e-mail address. In some cases, an employee worries that a supervisor or co-worker might think the employee solicited the mail. In other cases, the person fears that an IT employee asked to assist with the computer might think the person had solicited the sexually-oriented mail. Most people who either have experienced spam or have read about spam understand that spammers do not wait to be asked; they are in the business of aggressive marketing. Many spammers are deceitful, trying to fool people into opening their unwanted e-mail by pretending to be someone else or using a subject line which fools the recipient into opening the mail. Sometimes they claim falsely that the person is receiving the e-mail because the person asked for it, or expressed interest in material of a similar nature. The truth is that few people welcome spam and even fewer ask for it. If a supervisor or co-worker thinks otherwise, IT can reassure them. Certainly, IT technicians and consultants understand that spam is a plague and not something invited by the recipient. As extra protection, depending upon how you receive your e-mail on campus, there are ways to quarantine spam and/or filter your incoming e-mail.  It is advisable to immediately delete any such emails you receive.",

We ask employees to provide at least two weeks of notice prior to leaving the organization.

Exit Interview Who will do the exit interview for an employee who is leaving the business? Typically, the exit interview occurs during the last few days of employment and is conducted by the HR Business Partner. Final Pay, Vacation Days, and Other Benefits My employee has requested to take vacation during their notice period – can I reject this request? Managers are entitled to deny vacation requests for individuals who have given their two weeks’ notice. However, PTO is earned along with an employee’s wage, and therefore employees are often entitled to cash out their remaining PTO hours, to be paid along with their final paycheck. One of my team is leaving the company. What do I do with the personnel records and files I still have? The Human Resources (HR) department retains personnel records in accordance with corporate policies on business records retention, as well as federal and state laws governing record retention. The HR department maintains both employee record information and government compliance reports. Both are subject to the retention policy. You can find a copy of the company policy here. Any records you may have on the separating employee should be given to HR for review and storage.",

        "content": "Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My Computer? Tools built to make use of the Internet easier have created special concerns for the holders of copyright. While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so. But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the \"fair use\" exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the \"fair use\" criteria. Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly. But what if I own legal copies of the material? Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others. In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called \"private\" sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law. What is legal to download? Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work. How will the rights-holder know? The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern. Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges. The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk. What happens if I get caught? Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or \"statutory\" damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For \"willful\" infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney's fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505. Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense. Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement. Does IT scan my computer for illegal files? Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic. In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported. Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.",

Definitions The term \"spam\" is Internet slang that refers to unsolicited commercial email (UCE) or unsolicited bulk email (UBE). Some people refer to this kind of communication as junk email to equate it with the paper junk mail that comes through the US Mail. Unsolicited email most often contains advertisements for services or products, but very few reputable marketers use UCE to advertise. The most commonly seen spam includes the following: Phishing scams, a very popular and dangerous form of email fraud Foreign bank scams or advance fee fraud schemes Pyramid schemes, including multilevel marketing (MLM) Other \"Get Rich Quick\" or \"Make Money Fast\" (MMF) schemes Quack health products and remedies Ads for pornographic web sites Offers of software for collecting email addresses and sending UCE Offers of bulk emailing services for sending UCE Chain letters (see About chain mail) Illegally pirated software (\"Warez\") To reduce the amount of spam you receive: Don't reply to spam Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used Be proactive Don't reply to spam If you reply to spam, the spammer or the automated program on the other end will then know that your address is connected to a live person, and the spammer will then bombard you with even more spam, and circulate your address to other spammers.

        "title": "What are phishing scams and how can I avoid them? ",
        "content": "Phishing explained Phishing Explained Phishing scams are typically fraudulent email messages appearing to come from legitimate enterprises (e.g., your company, your Internet service provider, your bank). These messages usually direct you to a spoofed web site or otherwise get you to divulge private information (e.g., passphrase, credit card, or other account updates). The perpetrators then use this private information to commit identity theft. One type of phishing attempt is an email message stating that you are receiving it due to fraudulent activity on your account, and asking you to \"click here\" to verify your information. Phishing scams are crude social engineering tools designed to induce panic in the reader. These scams attempt to trick recipients into responding or clicking immediately, by claiming they will lose something (e.g., email, bank account). Such a claim is always indicative of a phishing scam, as responsible companies and organizations will never take these types of actions via email. Specific types of phishing Phishing scams vary widely in terms of their complexity, the quality of the forgery, and the attacker's objective. Several distinct types of phishing have emerged. Spear phishing Phishing attacks directed at specific individuals, roles, or organizations are referred to as \"spear phishing\". Since these attacks are so pointed, attackers may go to great lengths to gather specific personal or institutional information in the hope of making the attack more believable and increasing the likelihood of its success. The best defense against spear phishing is to carefully, securely discard information (i.e., using a cross-cut shredder) that could be used in such an attack. Further, be aware of data that may be relatively easily obtainable (e.g., your title at work, your favorite places, or where you bank), and think before acting on seemingly random requests via email or phone. Whaling The term \"whaling\" is used to describe phishing attacks (usually spear phishing) directed specifically at executive officers or other high-profile targets within a business, government, or other organization. Avoiding phishing scams The Company and other reputable organizations will never use email to request that you reply with your passphrase, Social Security number, or confidential personal information. Be suspicious of any email message that asks you to enter or verify personal information, through a web site or by replying to the message itself. Never reply to or click the links in a message. If you think the message may be legitimate, go directly to the company's web site (i.e., type the real URL into your browser) or contact the company to see if you really do need to take the action described in the email message. When you recognize a phishing message, delete the email message from your Inbox, and then empty it from the deleted items folder to avoid accidentally accessing the web sites it points to. Always read your email as plain text. Phishing messages often contain clickable images that look legitimate; by reading messages in plain text, you can see the URLs that any images point to. Additionally, when you allow your mail client to read HTML or other non-text-only formatting, attackers can take advantage of your mail client's ability to execute code, which leaves your computer vulnerable to viruses, worms, and Trojans. Warnings Reading email as plain text is a general best practice that, while avoiding some phishing attempts, won't avoid them all. Some legitimate sites use redirect scripts that don't check the redirects. Consequently, phishing perpetrators can use these scripts to redirect from legitimate sites to their fake sites. Another tactic is to use a homograph attack, which, due to International Domain Name (IDN) support in modern browsers, allows attackers to use different languagecharacter sets to produce URLs that look remarkably like the authentic ones. Reporting phishing attempts If the phishing attempt targets the Company in any way (e.g., asks for the Company's Webmail users to \"verify their accounts\", includes a malicious PDF directed to human resources, or impersonates the Company), forward it with full headers to the Company Information Security Office. You can report a phishing scam attempt to the company that is being spoofed. You can also send reports to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Depending on where you live, some local authorities also accept phishing scam reports. Finally, you can send details to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, which is building a database of common scams to which people can refer.

        "content": "PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND COMPENSATION PROGRAMS In order to attract and retain a highly qualified and competent work force, XYZ has instituted a performance management program to compensate employees in a fair and equitable manner based upon demonstrated job performance, and in accordance with its Equal Employment Opportunity policy. Through this program employees will receive constructive work reviews designed to address performance and skill developmental needs and interests. Upon an employee's anniversary date, an employee becomes eligible for consideration of a salary review. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM SCHEDULE Employees may receive constructive work reviews on the following schedule: FULL-TIME NON-PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES: 3 month work review annual work and salary review, based on anniversary of start date. FULL-TIME PROFESSIONAL LEVEL EMPLOYEES: 6 month work review annual work and salary review, based on anniversary of start date. PART-TIME EMPLOYEES: annual work and salary review Under usual and appropriate circumstances, employees should receive a performance review annually. If an employee's job responsibilities change substantially at any time after the annual work review, however, another may be performed before the next annual review, after the new assignment has begun. PAYMENT OF SALARY Salary payment is made bi-weekly for base salary due up to the pay date. Paydays usually are bi-weekly on every other Friday. Overtime payment, which is included with the non-exempt employee's base salary payment, is also paid bi-weekly with such payment covering hours worked in the prior bi-weekly period. (For additional explanations see section on overtime policy and procedures.) It is the Company's policy that employee paychecks will only be given personally to that employee. All other arrangements for mailing or pick-up must be made in advance and in writing with the Human Resources Department. If the normal payday falls on a Company-recognized holiday, paychecks will be distributed one workday prior to the aforementioned schedule. Under no circumstances will the Company release any paychecks prior to the announced schedule. Employees may be paid by check or through direct deposit of funds to either a savings or checking account at their bank of choice (providing the bank has direct deposit capability). To activate direct deposit, a Direct Deposit Authorization form from Human Resources may be obtained and the employee should have his/her bank complete the form. The completed form must then be returned with a voided personal check to the Human Resources Department. Due to banking requirements it may take several weeks for activation of the Direct Deposit. A check encashment card for XYZ Company may be provided if the employee does not choose direct deposit. In the event of a lost paycheck, the Human Resources Department must be notified in writing as soon as possible before a replacement check can be issued. In the event the lost paycheck is recovered and the Company identifies the endorsement as that of the employee, the employee must remit the amount of the replacement check to the Company within 24 hours of the time it is demanded. A statement of earnings is given each pay period to employees indicating: Gross Pay Statutory Deductions Voluntary Deductions The amount of Federal withholding is affected by the number of exemptions claimed on Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate. If an employee's marital status changes or the number of exemptions previously claimed increases or decreases, a new Form W-4 must be submitted to the Human Resources Department. Except for extreme emergencies and vacation pay, no salary advances will be made. OVERTIME PAY Depending on Company work needs, employees will be required to work overtime when requested to do so. Prior approval of a supervisor, however, is required before any non-exempt employee works overtime. Employees working overtime without approval will be subject to disciplinary action. Non-exempt full-time employees are eligible for additional pay for work performed beyond their regularly scheduled 35 weekly hours. Hours at XYZ are generally 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, with a one hour lunch period each day. The first 5 hours after the normal 35 hours worked in a week are paid at the employee's regular hourly rate; after the employee has worked the normal 40 hours, all additional time is paid at a rate of 1 times the employee's hourly rate. Employees are responsible for calculating their own hours on a daily basis. Each day, the time the employee starts and finishes work must be recorded on a time record. The employee's supervisor must approve his/her hours worked at the end of each week. All additional overtime worked must be approved by a supervisor each day. Additionally, time records with overtime must be countersigned by the supervisor and must be in the Payroll Department by 10:00 a.m. the Monday preceding payday in order for an employee's pay to be processed for payday. TIME RECORDS The attendance of all employees is recorded daily by each department and is submitted to the Human Resources Department weekly. Our attendance records are Company records, and care must be exercised in recording the hours worked, overtime hours, and absences. Employees are not to clock or sign in or out for other employees. Violations of this policy may result in appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including immediate discharge. All non-exempt employees must record the time they arrived/departed, each day, on his/her time record. Each employee is responsible only for his/her own recordkeeping. Lunch time is one hour unless otherwise indicated in the space provided on the time register (subject to your supervisor's approval on a daily basis). Once an employee clocks or signs in, work is to commence immediately. Failure to do so is considered falsification of timekeeping records. If an employee forgets to clock or sign in or out, he or she must notify his or her supervisor immediately so the time may be accurately recorded for payroll. Non-exempt employees must calculate their overtime on a weekly basis (see overtime section for further explanation). An employee's supervisor, as well as Human Resources must approve each overtime entry; employees with overtime entries that do not have prior approval will be subject to disciplinary action. Exempt employees are not required to sign in or out; however, business trips, vacation, sick and personal days must be recorded on the attendance sheet by the employee designated to monitor attendance. EMPLOYEE REFERRAL PROGRAM The Company is always looking for qualified employees and appreciates recommendations made by existing employees. If you recommend someone who is hired on a full-time, permanent basis and who is still employed by the Company after 90 days, you are eligible to be paid a recruiting bonus. This may be changed from time to time depending on existing market conditions. The current referral fee for a full-time employee is $100. We may from time to time pay a higher recruiting bonus for particular positions. PERSONNEL RECORDS To keep necessary Company records up to date, it is extremely important that you notify the Human Resources Department of any changes in: Name and/or marital status Address and/or telephone number # of eligible dependents W-4 deductions Person to contact in case of emergency",

        "content": "Employee Anti-Harassment Policy Policy Statement Service-now.com prohibits any kind of harassment of its employees on the basis of sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief, either in the working environment or during any social or business event organized by the Company. It is seen as an infringement of the dignity of individuals that no one should have to tolerate. Harassment is where behavior/ conduct occurs, on one of the prohibited grounds, which has the effect of violating the other persons dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that person that is uninvited and unwelcome. Some examples of harassment are: Insults, ridicule and verbal or written statements of a sexual, racial or disability based nature which include degrading comments about an employee's sex, race or disability; Lewd, suggestive or overly familiar behavior, which includes sexually motivated contact, graphic remarks about an employee's body, sexual propositions and the display or circulation of indecent objects, sexually suggestive material and pictures. Explicit or implicit threats or insinuation that sexual favor may further an employee's Career. Or conversely, that lack of them may hinder or affect career advancement. Sexual harassment can be applied either to men or women by the opposite sex but it is also unacceptable when exhibited by someone towards a member of their own sex. Race and disability discrimination are equally unacceptable when exhibited by someone towards their own race or, for example, where the person carrying out the disability based harassment is themselves disabled. Responsibilities All managers are responsible for providing an environment free from harassment and taking appropriate disciplinary action, which may include dismissal, against employees of whatever level who contravene the policy. Employees should keep records of incidents, including times and places, and wherever possible obtain support from a colleague who may have witnessed anything relevant to the incident(s) in question. An employee is responsible for reporting any act of harassment to member of management, all of whom are required to deal with the matter seriously and promptly. If an employee feels unable to report the matter to their immediate manager or supervisor a report should be made to any other member of management. Management Guidelines A manager who receives a report alleging harassment should take detailed notes of the complaint and should reassure the employee(s) concerned that the matter will be treated in confidence and will be investigated promptly. The manager should immediately advise the VP EMEA and the HR Director of the allegation. The VP EMEA, together with the HR Director and the manager who received the allegation, will agree a plan that ensures that the matter is thoroughly investigated and the facts established as soon as possible. Once the facts are established the VP EMEA (or his / her nominee) will determine the subsequent course of action to be followed. In the situation where the investigation establishes that harassment has taken place the matter will be dealt with in accordance with local disciplinary procedures. The manager who received the original report of harassment is responsible for ensuring that the employee who made the allegation is advised of the outcome of their complaint.",

        "content": "Washing comforter using FabriKare When you first unpack your down comforter it may appear wrinkled and flat. You can restore it by shaking or fluffing it in your dryer on Wrinkle Prevent. If you're using your dryer add a couple of dryer balls or rings to help fluff the feathers. Air out your new comforter for a day or two before using it for the first time and then every few months thereafter. With proper care, your down comforter will give you years of comfort. A comforter cover can extend its life even more. For long term storage consider using a vacuum storage bag. It keeps the comforter flat to save space, but more importantly it's going to keep it clean and dry. Washing your Comforter - If you plan to machine wash your down comforter, wash it separately regardless of size. Use WARM water and mild detergent on a BEDDING cycle (never bleach this item). You may have to rinse the comforter more than once to remove any excess laundry detergent. Tip: Although more time intensive, you may also consider hand washing your comforter. Drying your Comforter - Dry on a low heat cycle in a large-capacity dryer. Use dryer balls or rings to help fluff the down feathers. To help your comforter dry evenly, remove the comforter from the dryer and re-position it. We suggest airing the comforter out on a comforter rack for a day or two after the drying cycle to ensure that the comforter is completely dry. Down & Fiber Filled Pillows - Sorry folks, these are Dry clean only. Air out Down or Feather pillows for a day or two before you begin using them and then every few months thereafter. Take your down and feather pillows to a reputable dry cleaner.",

        "content": "What is a Beneficiary? A beneficiary is a person or legal entity that is entitled to receive the proceeds from an estate, trust, retirement account, life insurance policy, or transfer on death accounts. A beneficiary can be one or more individuals or organizations, such as a trust or charity. You can designate two types of beneficiaries: Primary beneficiaries are first in line to receive the designated asset upon your death. Secondary (or contingent) beneficiaries receive the asset if there are no surviving primary beneficiaries upon your death. Importance of Beneficiary Designations Named beneficiaries on insurance policies and retirement accounts generally supersede instructions in wills which is why it is important to file and keep your beneficiary designations up to date. By periodically reviewing your beneficiary designations for your benefit plans, personal insurance plans, and other financial accounts, you can rest assured that your assets will be distributed according to your wishes. Review Your Beneficiary Designations Review and update your beneficiaries when: You experience a major life event such as a birth, marriage, dissolution of marriage or domestic partnership, or death in the family. You update your will or estate plan. Consult with your legal advisor when you create a will to make sure that you understand whether the beneficiary designations you make on insurance plans or financial accounts are affected by your will. You roll over a 401(k) or Individual Retirement Account (IRA). You receive a beneficiary verification notice. Keep copies of your beneficiary designation forms. If you do not have copies of your current beneficiary designations, request copies from your account providers or complete a new beneficiary designation form—see instructions below. Since the designations you make can override your will, we recommend you consult with a legal advisor and/or an estate planning professional before you make changes. Life Insurance Beneficiaries All employees are covered for $25,000 of employer-provided life insurance and $5,000 AD&D insurance (under Part A should have designated their beneficiaries at the time of enrollment. Consider the following: If you wish to name someone other than your spouse or domestic partner as beneficiary, if you have special estate planning needs, or if you wish to assign ownership of your life insurance to another person, seek legal and tax advice before completing your beneficiary designation. If your marriage or domestic partnership dissolves, review your beneficiary designations to determine whether you need to make changes. If your beneficiary is a minor (under age 18), you may wish to consult with a legal advisor to ensure you understand how to best protect the rights of your minor beneficiary. Employee death benefits are paid to the most recent beneficiary designation on file with the Benefits Office.

        "title": "Travel and Expense Policy",
        "content": "Corporate Travel and Expense Policy Overview It is the policy of [Company Name] to reimburse staff for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with approved travel on behalf of the company. [Company Name] strongly encourages use of travel discounts when making travel arrangements. Travelers seeking reimbursement should incur the lowest reasonable travel expenses and exercise care to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety. Reimbursement is allowed only when reimbursement has not been, and will not be, received from other sources. If a circumstance arises that is not specifically covered in this travel policy, then the most conservative course of action should be taken. Business travel policies are aligned with company reimbursement rules. All business-related travel paid with [Company Name] funds must comply with company expenditure policies. Authorization and responsibility Staff travel must be authorized. Travelers should verify that planned travel is eligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements. Within 30 days of completion of a trip, the traveler must submit a Travel Reimbursement form and supporting documentation to obtain reimbursement of expenses. An individual may not approve his or her own travel or reimbursement. The Travel Reimbursement form must be signed by the executive director or the director of finance (for travel over $1,000) or by the business manager (for travel under $1,000). Travel and reimbursement for members of the management team must be approved by the executive director or the director of finance (if not for that individual), and will be reviewed annually by the internal auditor. Designated approval authorities are required to review expenditures and withhold reimbursement if there is reason to believe that the expenditures are inappropriate or extravagant. Personal funds Travelers should review reimbursement guidelines before spending personal funds for business travel to determine if such expenses are reimbursable. See Section II: Travel Expenses/Procedures for details. [Company Name] reserves the right to deny reimbursement of travel-related expenses for failure to comply with policies and procedures. Travelers who use personal funds to facilitate travel arrangements will not be reimbursed until after the trip occurs and proper documentation is submitted. Vacation in conjunction with business travel In cases in which vacation time is added to a business trip, any cost variance in airfare, car rental or lodging must be clearly identified on the Travel Request form. [Company Name] will not prepay any personal expenses with the intention of being “repaid” at a later time, nor will any personal expenses be reimbursed. Exceptions Occasionally it may be necessary for travelers to request exceptions to this travel policy. Requests for exceptions to the policy must be made in writing and approved by the executive director or by the director of finance. Exceptions related to the director’s or the director of finance’s expenses must be submitted to the opposite person or to the treasurer of the board of trustees for approval. In most instances, the expected turnaround time for review and approval is five business days. Travel Expenses/Procedures General information Authorized business travel for staff that includes prepayments must be pre-approved. Reimbursement of parking, mileage, gasoline in lieu of mileage and ferry or bus passes do not require requests if they are under $10. Requests for reimbursement of expenses over $10 are to be submitted on a Travel Reimbursement form. Permissible prepaid travel expenses Before the travel, [Company Name] may issue prepayments for airfare, rail transportation, rental vehicles, conference registration fees and cash advances. Applicable policies and methods of payments for these prepayments follow. Airfare. Travelers are expected to obtain the lowest available airfare that reasonably meets business travel needs. Airfare may be prepaid by the business office. Travelers are encouraged to book flights at least 30 days in advance to avoid premium airfare pricing. First-class tickets are not reimbursable. Coach class or economy tickets must be purchased for domestic or international flights (defined as flight time totaling less than five consecutive hours excluding layovers). A higher-priced coach ticket cannot be purchased for a subsequent upgrade in seating. A less-than-first-class ticket (i.e., business class) may be purchased at [Company Name]’s discretion for domestic or international flights (defined as flight time exceeding five consecutive hours excluding layovers). Airfare may be purchased with a credit card or check through the business office with a Request for Payment form. Rail transportation. [Company Name] will prepay rail transportation provided that the cost does not exceed the cost of the least expensive airfare. Rental vehicles. [Company Name] will pay for approved use of a rental vehicle. See the section on reimbursements below in this section. Conference registration fees. Conference registration fees can be prepaid with a credit card or check through the business office with a Request for Payment form.

See Meals (per diem) for more detail. Travel advances. Cash advances are authorized for specific situations that might cause undue financial hardship for business travelers. These situations are limited to staff traveling on behalf of [Company Name]. A maximum of 80 percent of the total estimated cost can be advanced. Expenses associated with the travel must be reconciled and substantiated within two weeks of the return date. The traveler must repay [Company Name] for any advances in excess of the approved reimbursable expenses. The department initiating the travel is responsible for notifying the business office to deposit any excess funds into the appropriate departmental account. Travel advances are processed by submitting a completed Request for Payment form and Travel Request form to the business office. Reimbursement for any remaining expenses is processed on a Travel Reimbursement form approved by the designated approval authority. Reimbursements Requests for reimbursements of travel-related expenses are submitted on a Travel Reimbursement form. This form must be accompanied by supporting documentation. If the requested reimbursement exceeds 20 percent of the total pre-trip estimate, the Travel Reimbursement form must be signed by the executive director or the director of finance. These forms must be submitted to the business office within two weeks after the trip is completed. Travel Reimbursement forms not submitted within this time frame require exception approval from the executive director or from the director of finance. Reimbursement of travel expenses is based on documentation of reasonable and actual expenses supported by the original, itemized receipts where required. Reimbursements that may be paid by [Company Name] are shown below. Airfare. If the airfare was not prepaid by the business office, an original itemized airline receipt, an e-ticket receipt/statement or an Internet receipt/statement is required. The receipt must show the method of payment and indicate that payment was made. Travelers are expected to obtain the lowest available airfare that reasonably meets business travel needs. Travelers are encouraged to book flights at least 30 days in advance to avoid premium pricing. Coach class or economy tickets must be purchased for domestic or international flights (defined as flight time totaling less than five consecutive hours excluding layovers). A higher-priced coach ticket cannot be purchased for a subsequent upgrade in seating. A less-than-first-class ticket (i.e., business class) may be purchased at [Company Name]’s discretion for domestic or international flights (defined as flight time exceeding five consecutive hours excluding layovers). First-class tickets are not reimbursable. Rail transportation. [Company Name] will pay for rail transportation provided that the cost does not exceed the cost of the least expensive airfare. If rail transportation was not prepaid by the business office, an original itemized receipt, original e-ticket receipt/statement or Internet receipt/statement is required. The receipt must show the method of payment and indicate that payment was made. Automobile (personally owned—domestic travel). A valid driver’s license issued within the United States and personal automobile insurance are required for expenses to be reimbursed. Drivers should be aware of the extent of coverage (if any) provided by his or her automobile insurance company for travel that is business or not personal in nature. Reimbursement for use of a personal automobile is based on the [Company Name] mileage rate. The Staff Travel Reimbursement form is required for reimbursement for all vehicle-related expenses, including gasoline, wear and tear, and personal auto insurance. As of [Date], the rate is [$X.XX] per mile. Travelers may opt to request reimbursement for gasoline in lieu of the [Company Name] mileage rate. In these instances original, itemized receipts are required. Automobile (rental—domestic travel). Reimbursement for a commercial rental vehicle as a primary mode of transportation is authorized only if the rental vehicle is more economical than any other type of public transportation, or if the destination is not otherwise accessible.

In certain circumstances larger vehicles may be rented, with supervisory approval. The rental agreement must clearly show the date and the points of departure/arrival, as well as the total cost. Drivers must adhere to the rental requirements, and restrictions must be followed. Original receipts are required. When vehicle rentals are necessary, [Company Name] encourages travelers to purchase collision damage waiver (CDW) and loss damage waiver (LDW) coverage. [Company Name] will reimburse the cost of CDW and LDW coverage; all other insurance reimbursements will be denied. Drivers should be aware of the extent of a coverage (if any) provided by his or her automobile insurance company for travel that is business or not personal in nature. Parking fees, tolls and other incidental costs associated with the vehicle use are not covered by the rental agreement. Travelers are strongly encouraged to fill the gas tank before returning the vehicle to the rental agency to avoid service fees and more expensive fuel rates. Conference registration fees. If the conference fee was not prepaid, [Company Name] will reimburse these fees, including business-related banquets or meals that are part of the conference registration. Original receipts to support the payment are required. If the conference does not provide a receipt, then a cancelled check, credit card slip/statement or documentation that the amount was paid is required for reimbursement. A prorated amount for the meals provided must be deducted from the traveler’s per diem. See Meals (per diem) for more detail. Entertainment activities such as golf outings and sightseeing tours will not be reimbursed. Registration fees paid directly by an individual will not be reimbursed until the conference is completed. Lodging (commercial). The cost of overnight lodging (room rate and tax only) will be reimbursed to the traveler if the authorized travel is 45 miles or more from the traveler’s home or primary worksite. Exceptions to this restriction may be approved in writing by the executive director or by the director of finance. [Company Name] will reimburse lodging expenses at reasonable, single occupancy or standard business room rates. When the hotel or motel is the conference or convention site, reimbursement will be limited to the conference rate. Only single room rates are authorized for payment or reimbursement unless the second party is representing the agency in an authorized capacity. If the lodging receipt shows more than a single occupancy, the single room rate must be noted. If reimbursement for more than the single room rate is requested, the name of the second person must be included. Meals (per diem). Per diem allowances are reimbursable for in-state overnight travel that is 45 miles or more from the traveler’s home or primary worksite. Per diem allowances are applicable for all out-of-state travel that is 45 miles or more from the traveler’s home or primary worksite. [Company Name] per diem rates are based on the U.S. General Services Administration Guidelines, which vary by city location. In addition to meals these rates include incidental expenses such as laundry, dry cleaning and service tips (e.g., housekeeping or porter tips). Incidental expenses, unless specifically cited in this policy, will not be reimbursed. Per diem reimbursements are based on departure and return times over the entire 24-hour day and are prorated accordingly. If a free meal is served on the plane, included in a conference registration fee, built in to the standard, single hotel room rate or replaced by a legitimate business meal, the per diem allowance for that meal may not be claimed. Receipts are not required for per diem allowances. Per diem allowances are reimbursed after the trip is completed. Business meals.

Company Travel is supported globally by CWT to ensure that the lowest-price fare is received. (Note: For complex travel (or Japan or South Korea employees) call CWT for booking. Be advised agent assisted booking incurs an increased booking fee. Airfare, Hotel and Rental Car should be booked together to reduce the per occurrence billing/expenses for the Company. Travel should be booked 14 days in advance or more for obtaining advance purchase discounts. Airfare must be paid on the traveler’s card or personal card in the event a card has not yet been issued. Please see section 3.5 Business Guest Travel for additional options. Control Point – Contingent workers will use the SURF Trip approval workflow. Once approval is provided then they can work with their contracting company to coordinate travel. Airline Credits – In the case of cancelled trips, airline credits must be used for future business trips. Any Airline credits not used within 90 days are subject to use at the company’s discretion.

Guidelines for Airfare Job Level Travel Class E-staff / Executive Officers Business Class International and First Class Domestic M8, M7, RW Business Class International and Premium Economy Domestic M6, M5, IC6, IC7 Premium Economy International and Economy Domestic M4, IC5 and below Economy on all flights Control Point – The above rules apply when booking Domestic or International business travel.Flight cost capped at $5K USD roundtrip flying Premium Economy and $10k USD roundtrip flying Business class. Hotels All hotel bookings must be completed within Concur Travel tool. Whenever possible Hotel bookings should be with company preferred suppliers, completed along with Flight booking or added to existing Flight itinerary if confirmed separately. Control Points – Trips of less than 50 miles one way generally do not qualify for reimbursement for an overnight stay. Vacation or Home rentals (Airbnb, VRBO, FlipKey, etc.) are not reimbursable. The employee is liable for cancellation charges if the cancellation of a guaranteed hotel reservation resulted in a “no show” billing without sufficient business justification. For exceptional booking outside Concur using a group rate or conference code provided by a AcmeTech Customer or partner, employees are required to email their confirmation to AcmeTechTravel@itinerary.internationalsos.com for company safety and security reporting. Hotels that require an advance deposit or are non-refundable, are to be avoided, if possible. Contingent workers will use the SURF Trip approval workflow. Once approval is provided then they can work with their contracting company to coordinate travel. Car Rental If while on business travel and employee uses the services of Car Rental, it should be classified as Car Rental. Employee should determine whether the use of Taxis or shuttles would be more cost effective (especially if there is a rental surcharge added for drivers under 25 years old) before renting a car. Control Points – National Car Rental or Enterprise Car Rental must be used for Car Rental. Enterprise negotiated rates & coverage only available in USA. Car type should be intermediate, and upgrade is not allowed unless applied at no additional cost or substantiated with proof of multiple AcmeTech employees or Business equipment. Rental Agreement must reflect AcmeTech, for Company’s automobile liability insurance to apply to the rental. In case of accident, please reach out to Car Rental company directly to file an incident report. Only a AcmeTech employee may be a designated driver of rental vehicle. Business Guest Travel For support with Business Guest Travel submit a request in the Employee Portal under Travel & Expense Concur selecting the Request Travel Help tile. The team will determine based on your guest type which process is applicable. Business Guest is defined as the following: Guest of AcmeTech who is not a Contingent Worker. Employee who needs to book travel within their first 21 days of employment (prior to receiving corporate card). Control Points – Guest Travel can no longer be supported by calling CWT directly and is not permitted on employee company cards. Contingent workers are non-employees of AcmeTech, who perform work under a contract to support a project, service, or temporary request for a set duration, and will not be supported under the Guest Travel process. Contingent workers will work with their contracting company to coordinate travel once SURF travel approval is obtained. General Expense Guidelines Expense Reporting Guidelines Do not pay the Credit Card Company directly; this results in a duplicate payment as all company card charges must be processed through Concur and payments are processed by AcmeTech. If the expense being requested for reimbursement was made on a Company credit card, the user must ensure the electronic expense is available in Concur prior to creating a request for reimbursement. All expenses must be submitted through Concur within 30 days of incurring the expense. Employees are encouraged to monitor the progress of approvals until reports are marked Processing Payment to manage rejections and/or approval delays. To minimize the Concur report transaction fees, please consolidate expense reports whenever possible. Company cards and spend privileges will be suspended as a result of late expense submission. Expenses placed on a T&E card or personal funds cannot be cross charged/allocated within the Expense Report. Please submit a ticket in the Employee Portal under Travel & Expense with the receiving departments VP approval for the cross charge/allocation to be reviewed by accounting. Please use business purpose and comment fields liberally to reduce auditor questions leading to unnecessary rejections.",

        "content": "It is sometimes tricky to connect your computer to the mobile device running router - especially when you have just changed your network settings. Windows XP is especially problematic in this. It is important to note that many operating systems cache wireless network information even if you have removed them or refreshed the settings. If your computer cannot find the wireless network, or can not connect to it, the advised procedure is: Run router and connect so it's fully up and running Wait approximately a minute Go to Comm Manager and turn wifi off Wait approximately 15 seconds Go to Comm Manager and turn wifi on again Search for the network again (it may take a few tries) The above trick works often, but not always. The followup procedure is as follows: Quit router Restart mobile device Remove any wifi networks related to router from your computer: Windows XP: Right click your wireless icon and choose \" View Available Wireless Networks \", click \" Change the order of preferred networks \", select the network name in the new window and click \" Remove \". Windows Vista: Right click on \" Network Connections \", select \" Network and Sharing Center \", select \" Manage Wireless Networks \" from the left hand side. Click on any router networks and then click \" Remove \". Disable and re-enable wifi on your  computer: Windows XP: Right click on your wireless icon and choose \" Repair \". Windows Vista: Right click on \" Network Connections \" and choose \" Diagnose and Repair \". Start router and \" Connect \" Searching for the network on your computer - you may have to refresh several times for the network to be found, and you may have to disconnect / reconnect or quit / restart router a few times. After you have successfully bonded the computer with router once, it usually keeps working without needing the above procedure unless you reinstall the software or change network settings. With the latter, the computer will often use the old settings even though you have told it to use different settings.",

        "title": "Device stops charging when running router",
        "content": "While using WifiRouter, your device may become warm. Especially older devices generate a lot of heat when using Cellular to Wi-Fi sharing. Due to hardware overheating protection in these devices, the device will automatically stop charging the battery (as charging the battery also creates a lot of heat). Generally this happens at the 48 degrees Celsius mark, though the value may differ on your device. There is no general solution to this problem, however there are some tricks you can use to lower heat generation and improve heat dissipation, prolonging the amount of time you can use WifiRouter in Cellular to Wi-Fi mode. Many of the devices that cannot run WifiRouter indefinitely \"out of the box\" can often be made to do so using these tricks: As soon as you are connected and using the internet through WifiRouter, press the power button on your device. On most devices this will turn off the screen while WifiRouter will continue to function. This will drastically reduce power usage (and thus heat generation), on some devices up to 50% ! If your device has an extendable keyboard, extending it will improve heat dissipation. If you are using the device while not being on the move, putting the device on your desk or table upside down (the screen facing the desk or table) will improve heat dissipation. If you have placed the device upside down on your desk or table, also removing the battery cover will improve heat dissipation. Placing the device approximately 1 to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet) from the client device's Wi-Fi antenna seems to be the sweet spot for the best signal quality. Please also make sure there are no objects in the \"line of sight\" between the device and the client antenna. Thiswill reduce Wi-Fi power usage. WifiRouter by default sets your device's Wi-Fi chip to full power, as this greatly improves reliability. However, you can manually change the power setting by going to Options -> Tools -> Wi-Fi -> Power control in WifiRouter. In our own experience there are only minor power improvements when setting the Wi-Fi chip to a lower power level, though it greatly affects reliability. Note that this option is not supported on all devices and this setting has to be re-configured every time you start Cellular to Wi-Fi sharing.",

        "title": "Configuring the Broadband Router",
        "content": "The Web-based configuration utility can be used to change the settings of the broadband router. A brief description of these settings is provided below. Startup and Log in Open an Internet browser and enter the broadband router's IP address. The following is the default IP address of the broadband router: http://192.168.123.254 After the connection is established, you will see the Web User Interface. There are two appearances of the Web User Interface, one for general users and one for system administrators. In the general user mode, you are able to see the settings, but you will not be able to change any settings. In the administrator mode, you will be able to change the settings. To log in as an administrator, enter the password in the System Password field and click Log in. The default password is admin. When the correct password is entered, the Web appearance will be changed into administrator configure mode. There are several options listed in the side menu for system administration. Status The Status option allows you to check the operating status of the broadband router: WAN Port Status If the WAN port is assigned a dynamic IP, there will be a Renew button and a Release button on the Sidenote column. You can click this button to renew or release the IP manually. Modem Status This will appear when a dial-up connection is selected. The modem status is displayed and the Manual Dial-up button will appear. After the modem achieves a connection, the Hang-up button will appear. Printer Status Some examples of printer status messages include \"Ready,\" \"Not ready,\" \"Printing…\", and \"Device error.\" When a job is printing, a Kill Job button may appear on the side column. Click this button to manually end the current printing job. Toolbox This option enables you to change the administrator password. The first screen you will see after you click Toolbox is the change password screen. Note: It is very important that you reset the password after you configure the broadband router. If you forget the system password, refer to the Console Mode section in this manual to reset a new one. You can click Reset to Default and then reboot your computer to restore the default settings of the broadband router. You can also obtain information about the Firmware version and the WAN's MAC Address in this area. Go to http://www.usr.com to look for any firmware updates for your broadband router. The Clone MAC button is useful when your ISP binds (or locks) your connection to a specific MAC address. Cloning the MAC address allows you to reassign the MAC address without registering it with your ISP. Some ISPs require that you register the MAC address. Primary Setup This option displays the connection method of the WAN port. When you are using a dial-up connection, the username and password dialog boxes will be shown here. LAN IP Address: The default IP address is 192.168.123.254. It is not recommended, but you can change it to fit your needs. If you change the LAN IP address, you should write down the new address. If you forget the new address, you will have to reset the broadband router and you will lose all your configuration settings. WAN Type: This option allows you to select the WAN connection type of your ISP. Click Change to choose one of the following five options: Static IP Address : This option is used if your ISP has assigned you a static IP address. Dynamic IP Address : This is used to obtain an IP address from your ISP automatically. PPP over Ethernet : Some ISPs require the use of PPPoE to connect to their services. This is generally used for DSL connections. Contact your ISP for more information. Dial-up Network : This option is used if you want to connect to the Internet through an analog modem or through an ISDN. More : This option allows you to manually add DNS information for the WAN port. Static IP Address WAN IP Address, Subnet Mask, Gateway, Primary and Secondary DNS: enter the proper setting value provided by your ISP. Dynamic IP Address Host Name: This entry is optional, but is required by some ISPs. Renew IP Forever: This feature enables the broadband router to renew the IP address automatically when the lease time is half, even if the system is in an idle state. This allows for always-on connectivity. PPP over Ethernet PPPoE Account and Password: This is the account and password that your ISP assigned to you. If you don't want to change the password, you may leave this field empty. PPPoE Service Name: This entry is optional, but your ISP may require this field to be filled in. Maximum Idle Time: This is the elapsed time of no activity before your PPPoE session is disconnected. Set this feature to 0 to disable it. Dial-up Network Dial-up Telephone, Account and Password: This is assigned by your ISP. Leave the password field empty if you do not want to change it. Primary and Secondary DNS: These fields are automatically assigned if they are configured as \"0.0.0.0.\" Maximum Idle Time: This is the elapsed time of no activity before your dial-up session is disconnected. Baud Rate: This is the communication speed between the broadband router and your modem or ISDN TA. Extra Setting: This is needed to customize the communication quality between the ISP and your modem. This is required for ISDN TA. DHCP Server The DHCP server of the broadband router is set for enabled by default. The settings of the TCP/IP environment include IP address, Subnet Mask, Gateway, and DNS configurations. If the DHCP server of the broadband router is enabled and you configure your PCs to obtain an IP address automatically, your PC will automatically load the proper TCP/IP information provided by the broadband router. The settings of DHCP server include the following items: DHCP Server: You are given two options: Disable and Enable. Range of IP Address Pool: Whenever there is a request, the DHCP server will automatically allocate an unused IP address from the IP address pool to the requesting PC. You can specify the starting and ending address of the IP address pool. Domain Name: This information is optional and will be provided to the client by the ISP. Some ISPs require that this information is entered. Selecting More allows the gateway information to automatically be entered. Virtual Server The broadband router's NAT (Network Address Translation) firewall filters out unrecognized packets to protect your intranet. All hosts behind this firewall are invisible externally. Enabling the Virtual Server Mapping will make some of the host's ports accessible. A virtual server is defined as a Service Port. All requests to this port will be redirected to the PC that is specified by the Server IP. Port forwarding sets up public services on your network. When Internet users make requests on your network, the broadband router will forward those requests to the appropriate computer. The broadband router's DHCP function must be disabled to use port forwarding. Port forwarding is generally used to set up a webserver, ftp server, or e-mail server on your network. To add a server using Forwarding, perform the following steps: Enter the port number and the IP Address of the server that you want to allow Internet users to access. Configure as many entries as desired until all the entries are filled in. Click Apply in order to save the settings. For example, if you have an FTP server (port 21) at 192.168.123.1, a Web server (port 80) at 192.168.123.2, and a PPTP VPN server at 192.168.123.6, you need to specify the following virtual server mapping table: Service Port Server IP Enable 20 192.168.123.1 V 21 192.168.123.1 V 80 192.168.123.2 V 1723 192.168.123.6 V",

        "content": "How To Read Your Paycheck Whether you get paid weekly, bi-weekly or monthly, all paychecks have the same basic information on them. Items required by federal law to appear on your paycheck Gross Pay : The total amount you earned before any taxes were withheld for the pay period. Net Pay : The amount of your check after all your withholdings are taken out. Federal Tax (Fed Tax, FT or FWT): The amount of federal tax withheld from your paycheck. It is determined by whether you’re married or single and how many allowances you claim on your W-4. State Tax (St Tax, ST, or SWT; occasionally appearing with a state abbreviation): This is the amount of state tax withheld from your paycheck. Depending on where you live, you may not have to pay state tax at all. On the other hand, you may have to pay dual state tax if you live in one state and work in another. The amount of taxes taken out is determined by your marital status and how many allowances you claim on your W-4. Local Tax : This uncommon tax could be withheld on wages earned in a city or county or within school district boundaries. Social Security (FICA, SS, SSWT or OASDI): The federal government requires that every employee have a percentage of his or her pay withheld for the Social Security fund. Each employer withholds 6.2 percent of your gross income for Social Security and then matches your withholdings. Medicare (MT or Med.): The amount withheld for Medicare is 1.45 percent of your gross income. Your employer also contributes 1.45 percent. This amount is withheld to ensure Medicare will cover you when you turn 65. Year-to-Date (YTD): This is the year-to-date total of your earnings and tax withholdings. Additional items that may appear on your paycheck Insurance deductions : Premium payments deducted by your employer for health, dental, vision or life insurance coverage. Retirement Plan Contributions : A percentage of your paycheck that’s contributed to a retirement plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b). Leave Time : The amount of vacation or sick hours you have. Most employers will detail how many have been used and how many are still available. Flexible Spending Account Deductions : A set amount you have designated for pre-tax benefit to be used for childcare assistance or medical assistance.

        "content": "Here is a list of many common broadband wired and wireless router settings and a description of what function it performs. It is important to remember that the exact names of different settings and options will differ, depending on your router manufacturer and the device's firmware. However, most will have similar settings and options. Access Control These options let you to control access, both in and out of your network. Access Control let you do things like grant access to approved Web sites, limit Web access, or even block Internet access for some applications such as Peer-to-peer file sharing or Internet gaming applications. Application Rules Application rules are used to open single or multiple ports on your router when the router senses data sent to the Internet on a \"trigger\" port or port range. Auto Channel / Channel Scan This option will enable the router to scan and find the channel with least interference and then use that channel for wireless networking. (see Wireless Channel below) DHCP Server Settings Short for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, the DHCP section is where you can configure the router's built-in DHCP Server to assign IP addresses to the computers and other devices on your local area network (LAN). Other DHCP options include Enable DHCP Server and Add or Edit DHCP Reservation. DMZ Short for demilitarized zone, the setting DMZ options allow you to expose a computer on your network to the Internet for use of a special-purpose service, like online gaming, VPN access, or videoconferencing. DNS DNS (Domain Name System ). If you don't know it, your ISP can provide you with at least one DNS to enter in this setting. Dynamic DNS (DDNS) Dynamic DNS, or DDNS is a setting lets you host a server, such as a Web server, FTP server or game server) using a domain name that you have purchased. Enable Wireless This setting is used to turn on and off the wireless connection feature of your router. Firewall Settings A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. This router setting is used to set a single computer on your network outside of the router. Firmware / Firmware Version This is the version of firmware used by your router. From this section in your settings you can also download firmware updates from the maufacturer. Gateway The gateway address is your ISP server's IP address. If you do not know it, your ISP can provide it. Inbound Filter(s) Inbound Filters are used to limit access to a server on your own network. Filter rules can be used with Virtual Server, Port Forwarding, or Remote Administration features. Internet IP This is your Router's IP address, when seen from the Internet. This address can be obtained from your own ISP MAC Address A unique ID assigned by the manufacturer of the network adapter (see MAC address). MAC Address Filter Short for Media Access Controller (MAC) filter, is used to control network access based on the MAC Address of the network adapter. The MAV address filter is used to allow or deny network or Internet access. Max Idle Time The Max Idle Time can be set to terminate the Internet connection after it has been inactive for a specified period of time, called the Max Idle Time MTU MTU is short for Maximum Transmission Unit. Here you can specify the largest packet size permitted for Internet transmission. An \"auto\" MTU option lets the router to select the best MTU for your Internet connection Port Forwarding This option is used to open multiple ports (or a range of ports) in your router and redirect data through those ports to a single PC on your network. PPPoE Short for Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet, this option only needs to be used if your ISP requires you to use a PPPoE. Pre-Shared Key You can set a key as a pass-phrase of up to 63 alphanumeric characters. It cannot be shorter than eight characters. Subnet Mask This is the Router's Subnet Mask, as it is seen by users on the Internet. If you do not know it, your ISP can provide it. System Logs This is where you access your router logs to view events. Text (for) Banner A \"text banner\" is a message that is displayed when someone logs in to the router. Text banners usually include a message to indicate that unauthorized access is prohibited. Visibility (Wireless) Status This setting lets you show or hide your wireless network. To hide the wireless network use the invisible option. In visible mode the network name is broadcast to anyone within the range of your signal. Website Filter The Web Filter option allows you to set up a list of allowed Web sites that can be used by multiple users, and any site not listed here will be blocked. WEP WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is a wireless encryption method. WEP is not as secure as WPA encryption. Wireless Channel You can manually choose the clearest channel to help optimize the performance and coverage of your wireless network (see above Auto Channel Scan). Wireless Network Name This is the name that will appear in the list when you browse for wireless networks (unless visibility is set to Invisible). Users should change the pre-configured network name. WPA WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) uses a variant of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) security standards published by the Wi-Fi Alliance. WPA Mode This option can be used if the clients to be used with the router only support the older standard.",

        "title": " CalHR's Supervisors Guide to Addressing Poor Performance ",
        "content": "Most state employees work hard and do a good job. Occasionally a supervisor is faced with an employee whose performance is unacceptable.   This Guide provides supervisors with a general outline for managing employee performance from conveying performance expectations when an employee is first hired through corrective feedback and adverse action if an employee’s performance does not improve. The Guide is organized into the following sections: Preventive Phase –guidelines on hiring and supervising employees through the probationary period. Corrective Phase - steps to identifying and addressing performance deficiencies and asking the employee to improve in anticipation of adverse action. This section includes the right to representation and the state’s “Progressive Discipline” policy. Formal Adverse Action Phase - description of the adverse actions process, including the legal causes for adverse action, the range of penalties, the contents of a formal Notice of Adverse Action, Skelly hearings, and formal appeal hearings. This section also describes other types of administrative actions you might be involved in that impact an employee’s work status. This guide book is intended as a guide only. There is no \"right\" way to manage employees. Each department has a separate culture and approach that may be different. As we state repeatedly throughout this guide, when in doubt, consult with your Human Resources (HR) office. You will find references to California Government Code in several sections of this guide. To review the specific code, please follow the instructions for \" How to find a California Law .\" What is the Difference between “Poor Performance” and “Misconduct?” Corrective feedback and adverse actions can be based on either poor performance or actual misconduct. This Guide focuses on “poor performance” -- meaning employees who complete the job requirements in a substandard way or complete some particular aspect of the job poorly.  Performance problems require “progressive discipline.”   This means that the employee is given notice of the deficiency, training and the opportunity to improve the performance problem.   Misconduct, however, does not always require progressive discipline. Poor performance refers to the problem behaviors that are repeated over time, undermine the employee’s value to the organization and burden coworkers. For example, the employee with a performance problem might be an employee who is always late, or leaves without notifying anyone; the employee who can’t seem to work cooperatively with his peers; the employee whose work is never on time or complete; and the employee who just doesn’t seem to do anything very well or is not performing satisfactorily.  All of these types of problems are performance issues. The second category of problem behavior is “misconduct” -- meaning the employee does something that is contrary to the nature of the job or state rules. Threatening violence against a coworker, stealing and dishonesty are examples of misconduct.  An employer can take adverse action against an employee who engages in these behaviors immediately without engaging in the corrective phase or progressive discipline.  In other words, there is no training course to teach someone how to not steal, employees are reasonably expected to know that this is unacceptable conduct. Before You Start: First, time is limited so don’t put off dealing with poor performance.  Make sure you know the length of each new employee's probationary periods.  The time limits on probationary periods and the statute of limitations on adverse actions, among other requirements, require you to stay on top of problems and address them directly, simply, and quickly. Second, always confer with your supervisor and your department’s Human Relations (HR) and Labor Relations (LR) staff about the policies and rules that relate to the particular employee. Every case is different; an employee’s rights are affected by MOU s, the job classification, the job description, and a variety of other factors. In addition, every department has its own procedures, and this Guide is intended to supplement advice you receive from your department’s HR or Legal staff, not substitute for it.  As a supervisor, you are expected and encouraged to ask for advice and get buy-in on any performance improvement strategy you consider. Addressing performance problems always requires a department-wide perspective.  Making sure that you are adopting an approach that is consistent with your department’s philosophy will ensure that all employees in the department are treated fairly and equally. PREVENTIVE PHASE: Hire smart and set the employee up to succeed from day one. Before You Hire: Never skip asking for and checking references. When you speak to references , ask open-ended questions about the employee’s work quantity and quality; how the employee gets along with coworkers, customers, and superiors; and whether the employee shows good judgment in prioritizing work and addressing unexpected problems. Ask for examples of specific assignments the employee has completed on his or her current job.  Ask how the employee handled each one.  Ask if the person would rehire the employee if given the opportunity.  This question always seems to elicit the most honest response. If the reference tells you that they only give dates of employment, ask if your obtaining the employee’s consent would permit a more open discussion.  And if not, ask the employee for additional references. If the employee gave you samples of his or her work, verify with the employee's reference that the employee prepared those products on his or her own. When you ask for references, you should also ask the employee for consent to review his or her personnel files.  Most departments have a form for this purpose. Make an appointment to review the OPF and take a member of your HR office to assist you in interpreting the transaction coding in the employee’s history. If the employee’s work history is mostly in the private sector, ask your HR office to help you devise a consent form that will cover private employment as well. Day One – “ On-Boarding ” for New Employees: “On-Boarding” means  welcoming and orienting your new employee to your division and department.  The time and effort you put into the \"onboarding\" process can pay off in increased employee morale and productivity. Your HR office will probably have a checklist for you to review with new employees.   Here are some points generally covered with a new hire: Explain the organization’s mission and culture, and how your unit and the employee’s job fit into the organization’s goals. Review the department organization chart, strategic plan, budget summary—anything that gives a good overview of the department’s mission and the reporting relationships, including from you to your boss and on up the chain. Explain department policies employees are expected to follow, and where to find those policies (on-line or in print?). For example, can the employee use personal electronic devices at work? What are the information and physical plan security requirements in the department? Explain your “work style” as a boss: What are your hours? How do your employees get your attention? Email? Phone call? Leave you a note? How do you make yourself available? Are you an “open door” boss, all the time or during certain hours? What if you’re not around-who should the employee ask for advice on a work assignment? What about advice on other administrative details like using leave or arriving late the next day? Review the duty statement for the job. (Some departments require the employee to sign). If revisions are needed, work with your HR office to get that revision made so the duty statement matches the job. Review your expectations for employees in your unit and this job in particular. For example, offer answers to the following questions for your new employee so she or he understands your basic expectations: When do you expect him or her to be at work? At a specific time every day? Is an alternative work schedule possible now or in the future? How do your employees “earn” the right to an alternative schedule? How does the employee get approval to use leave time? What do you expect if the employee realizes he/she will be late? What about using sick leave? Who to call? When? Do you expect employees to offer to help others when their assignments are done? What are your priorities in the unit? What’s the most important work that the new employee should always put first? What quantity of work do you expect? How many units per week or month? Check the MOU for the job—it may have information on workload expectations. Give examples of what successful employees in the job have produced. What quality of work do you expect? If you have a simple memo that reflects the quality you expect, share it with your new employee. Explain when probation reports are due and set the dates on your calendars. Review any Unit-Wide Expectations Memoranda. Many departments encourage supervisors to give a general expectations memo to the supervisor’s entire unit. These memos outline basic work rules regarding work schedules, calling in and requesting leave time, reporting whereabouts and other department-wide or unit-wide rules. If you have provided this type of memorandum to the employees in your unit, make sure your new employee receives a copy as well. Ask about the employee’s needs and work style as well.  For example, you could ask, “What do you feel you already know? How can I help you get started? What kind of programs/processes did you use on your last job?  Is there training you think you will need? Ask the employee if they understand the “onboarding” discussion and answer any questions so you both share an understanding of what’s expected. Walk the employee around the work site; introduce them to coworkers; if a coworker can help with something especially well, tell the employee about that person. Example: “If you need to put together a contract, talk to Samantha here—she’s great at that.”  Make sure the employee is comfortable with the physical plant in general and his/her work station. No matter how busy you are, make yourself available to talk and answer questions in the employee's first few days.  Don’t wait for the employee to come to you; visit the employee’s work station and ask how things are going.  And remember, on boarding is an interactive process that requires you to communicate with and support your new employees.  Do not hand a new employee the department manual and a link to the department website and expect them to simply orient themselves. Probation Reports: Your HR office can tell you what the probationary period will be for the job and when reports are due. Tell the employee about probation reports, show the employee the form you will use, and calendar meeting dates to discuss the probation reports for about one week before the reports are due.  If the employee has problems during the probationary period, this is a red flag.  Provide plenty of feedback, training and document the feedback. Annual Evaluations: Departments vary on when the required yearly performance review is completed. Some departments expect you to evaluate the employee on the employee’s anniversary date. Other departments do all of the evaluations at the same time department wide. The form used for evaluations, the factors considered, and other rules may vary as well.  Your HR office is the best source of information about the process. Whatever it is, a thorough supervisor’s file makes annual evaluations much easier because you have specific examples ready when you complete your evaluations. CORRECTIVE PHASE: Correcting Performance Problems: You’ve hired the best person for the job and you’ve done everything you can to explain the job clearly.  You have made yourself available and offered training and support, but unfortunately your employee’s performance is still below the acceptable level.  It’s time to implement the Corrective Phase. In the Corrective Phase, you explain to the employee exactly how she or he is not meeting job expectations and what the employee needs to do to bring his or her performance up to an acceptable level.  An excellent tool for conveying this explanation is the \" Work Improvement Plan .\"  You point out concrete examples of unacceptable job performance and explain specifically how the employee’s actions fell short of your expectations.  You identify precise actions the employee can take and training or additional guidance the employee may need.  Either the employee’s performance improves or, with buy-in from your supervisor and the help of your HR office, further action will be taken. You must provide a meaningful opportunity for the employee to learn and improve. Generally it will work, and you will never have to reach the Formal Adverse Action Phase. That in itself is a victory.  However, if the employee continues to make the same mistakes and you have to move into the Formal Adverse Action Phase, your good faith efforts to correct the problem will show your compliance with the state’s progressive discipline policy. A critical element of the Corrective Phase is giving feedback and documenting employee performance.  This gives the employee fair and clear notice about how to improve and creates a record that the employee received notice, training and ample opportunity to improve.  The next sections discuss the right way to give feedback and document your efforts to help your employees improve. Giving Feedback on Employee Performance: Most people are comfortable giving positive feedback but less so with giving critical feedback, even when the goal is improving performance on the job.  Giving constructive feedback is a skill that good supervisors must first learn and then practice. Use the resources available on the CalHR training page to help you think through both what you want to say and how you want to say it. Here are some basic tips: Set a good example.  Treat your subordinates and coworkers with respect.  Don’t play favorites.  Be fair, adaptable, considerate and solution-oriented. If employees don’t like a rule or procedure, ask for suggestions, but make it clear that just ignoring or working around an established process is not acceptable. Recognize the good your employees do.  Tell them you appreciate it and how it helps the organization. Celebrate accomplishments of your group; for example, bring in cookies when a big project is completed.  Sometimes, you can just celebrate for no particular reason other than to build camaraderie. Praise in public, and correct in private – be sensitive to the environment and other employees who may be watching and listening. Be factual and specific - on this day, this incident happened and it had this impact (good/bad).  Use numbers and examples.  Share examples of good work. Stay away from generalizations and exaggerations. “You’re always late” is never true, and undermines your credibility with your employees. “You have been late three of five days this week” is precise and focused. Explain how the employee’s performance is affecting coworkers and the organization in general.  If an employee’s failures are causing a problem for coworkers, say so.  If the employee is a big help, say so. If you’re talking about correcting a problem, tell the employee what you would like to see in the future.  Ask the employee if she or he understands and can comply or whether further clarification is needed. Deal with problems as soon as possible, as they arise.  If you wait until the next evaluation, it is less effective and may seem unfair.  Worse, delay may cause you to miss important deadlines, such as, the end of a probationary period. No matter how uncomfortable you feel, these issues matter and you need to handle the conversation seriously.  You set the tone; keep it professional and stick to the facts.  Avoid jokes, sarcasm, interrupting, being overly dramatic or exaggerating the problem. Nobody likes to be criticized so do not be surprised if the employee to be defensive.  If the atmosphere is too charged, set a time to get back together.  The discussion is not an argument and you don’t have to “win” the point. As a final step, ask the employee if they understand your point and agree with the changes you are asking them to make.  Engaging the employee in the solution is a great way to gain their buy-in.  Document their suggestions and try to find common ground.  If the employee is not willing to acknowledge the problem or agree to solutions, note that as well. Do not ask the employee or guess at what is motivating the poor performance.  For example, it is not appropriate to say, “I know things are tough at home but . . .” or “I know you’ve been sick for a while now, but . . . .”  Getting personal will get you off track, and can result in legal problems for you and your department if you overstep the supervisor’s role.  If the employee does bring up a personal problem, you may need to refer the employee to other resources within your department. What’s the Point of Talking about Improving Work Performance? Nobody enjoys talking about performance problems but supervisors have to do it because: It works:  Most performance problems are resolved by reviewing what is expected of the employee, talking over what went wrong in those instances where the expectation is not met, and deciding on a new course of action for the future. It’s fair: not just fair to the employee with the problem; it is fair to the whole unit and department. Other employees will notice and respect the fact that when a performance problem comes up, you give the employee a chance to improve.  This observation can foster trust and patience if an employee’s failures are causing extra work for his or her coworkers. The State Personnel Board requires progressive discipline:  That means that departments must encourage and support employee performance improvement before taking action.  “The purpose of progressive discipline is to provide the employee with an opportunity to learn from prior mistakes and to take steps to improve his or her performance on the job.” Before You Have a Counseling Meeting: Make sure your supervisor and HR staff members are aware of the problem and support your plan for addressing it. You need to discuss with your own supervisor your plan for corrective action: the problem and the change you are asking the employee to make. You also need to discuss with your supervisor the next steps if the employee fails to improve as expected. Check the applicable MOU about any special procedures or rights the employee has when being counseled on a performance problem. Does this employee have a “Right to Representation” in a counseling meeting ? Talk to your HR or LR staff to make sure you understand the employee's rights before the meeting. Is the employee classified as a peace officer or a firefighter, EMT or paramedic? Special rules apply .  Again, consult with your HR or LR staff. Prepare an outline of what you want to say. Be specific, stick to the facts, and include: A review of the performance expectations for the job; have available copies of any documents you have shared with the employee about those expectations, like duty statements, or emails about assignments. Specifically identify the performance problem, the gap between what is expected and what this employee is doing. Explain the impact on the group because of the employee’s performance.  For example, is the unit missing deadlines?  Have others had to work overtime to make up for the employee’s poor performance? Identify the specific things you want the employee to do in the future to eliminate that performance gap, and what you can do to support the change with training, mentoring, or other resources.  Be ready to tell the employee the solution to the problem. If you think training might help the employee, talk to your department’s training officer about whether the employee’s deficiencies might be corrected through training.  Identify any classes that could be effective for the employee’s problem areas.  For example, if the employee has difficulty writing clearly, check into writing classes.  If the employee has already been to training and the problem persists, you don’t have to repeat it, but document that you completed training options as part of the Corrective Phase. Logistics and Attitude: Set Up the Counseling Meeting to Succeed: You will need: Privacy - if you don’t have a private office, find a private room to use for the meeting. Enough time.  If you think you’ll need 30 minutes to convey your feedback, plan on spending at least twice that long to allow for conversation and questions. Copies of documents you want to use as examples, good and bad, to illustrate your points. Scheduling a Meeting with the Employee and the Right to Representation: If you tell an employee you want to meet to discuss their performance, he may ask to bring a union representative to the meeting.  Check with your HR office and review the employee’s MOU with your LR office in order to learn about the employee’s right to representation and how to handle the request. As a very general rule of thumb, if the meeting is likely to solicit information that might result in discipline, the meeting might be considered an “investigatory interview, and the employee may be entitled to have a representative attend the meeting.  On the other hand, giving day to day assignments or feedback to an employee in a routine meeting, does not trigger a right to representation.  Special rules apply to some job classifications, especially peace officers, firefighters, Emergency Medical Technicians, and paramedics.  So again, always consult with your HR staff and/or the LR office to make sure you understand any MOU guidelines that apply to that employee’s rights. Where is the line between investigatory and routine meetings?  That depends on the facts and your department’s practices.  Do not try to figure this out on your own; ask for help. Having the Conversation: Review the performance expectations you have established for the job.  Point out where the employee’s performance deviates from the expectations.  Tell the employee what he or she needs to do to meet the standard and explain the support you will provide. Remember, your goal is to reach an understanding with the employee about how to correct the performance gap. Focus on the specific problem: what happened, when, where, who was affected by the problem. Then talk about what you need the employee to do in the future. Avoid joking or trying to “break” the tension; it’s a tense situation, and the best way to handle these types of conversations is to be clear, focused, and fair. Stay calm. If the employee gets defensive, angry or criticizes you, don’t get distracted (e.g., “You never liked me”).  If the employee makes a legitimate point, say you appreciate it and will consider it. Don’t argue and don’t expect the employee to agree with you.  You are the boss and you are in charge of figuring out what the employee’s job requires.  Just stick with your agenda and cover the points you want to make. Stick with the facts.  Don’t get personal.  Don’t speculate about the employee’s health or personal life.  (But do respond if the employee raises personal issues in response to your corrective counseling.) The following are examples of discussions with an employee about performance problems, offered to get you thinking about how you might want to conduct the conversation. What if the Employee Brings Up a Personal Problem? Throughout this guide, we advise you not to ask the employee if they are having a personal or medical problem, but instead to focus on the employee's actual performance.   As a supervisor, when you inquire into an employee’s health or personal life, even with the best of intentions, you can find yourself accused of inappropriate conduct. For example, after an employee advises you that he will need a medical leave for chemotherapy, you might ask a series of questions intended to be supportive, such as whether anyone in his family had cancer or how long the treatment will last.  These are all well intended questions but these types of questions might later cause that employee to accuse you of violating his or her leave rights or other laws protecting against discrimination and the employee's privacy. But even where you don’t raise it, an employee who is in the Corrective Phase may bring up a personal or medical problem as a way of explaining performance problems.  What should you do?  Tell the employee you hear them, but you need to get back to them and schedule a follow-up meeting. Then check with your HR office. Most departments have a staff member who is up-to-date on the various laws relating to medical and personal leave issues.  Generally, you will find that you can: Offer EAP – EAP stands for the Employee Assistance Program .  It is a counseling program offered as a benefit to all state employees.  One of the positives about offering EAP to an employee is it keeps you out of the employee’s personal problems so you can focus on work performance issues.  (Remember, you cannot put information regarding EAP referrals or referrals for other types of medical assessments in your supervisor’s file; again, the HR and LR offices can help you determine how to keep your records). If your employee indicates s/he has a disability, contact your Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator or your EEO Officer for assistance.  Do not try to determine how best to accommodate an employee with a disability without obtaining assistance from appropriate staff who are trained in this area. Sometimes an employee can take some form of paid or unpaid leave to deal with health or personal problems, such as a substance abuse problem.  But again, this is not a decision any supervisor makes alone.  These issues should be handled consistently department-wide and your HR staff will need to work with you to identify the options and how to discuss leave with the employee. Following Up: You should document the discussion and any conclusions you reached.  This documentation is for your records and is not generally given to the employee since it is just your record of what you said to the employee.   In the next section we provide detailed guidance on how to document both feedback and corrective action.  For some job classifications, the MOU determines how you keep the record, and the requirements you must meet before you can put a record in your supervisor’s file.  The MOUs also cover whether you should give a copy to the employee.  So always review the MOU and discuss it with your LR office to make sure your documentation meets the rules. Documenting the Feedback You Give: Whenever you conclude a performance discussion with an employee, whether it is just delivering a compliment or a private sit-down to discuss a problem, make a record about what was said and add the notes to your supervisor’s file right away. Documentation does not need to be a burden. Emailing yourself has the advantage of noting the time and date of your feedback.  Whether hand written or electronic, the points to cover are simple: Date of your meeting or conversation (and again, emailing yourself right away takes care of that automatically). What you said. What the employee said. Any changes you are making with the goal of improving the employee’s performance, such as a shift change or different assignment. The employee’s response whatever it might be. Documenting Employee Performance: You should keep records on each of the employees you supervise.  Documentation is your record that you are doing the right thing as a supervisor.  If you make it a habit, it won’t take that much time or effort, and it is an important aspect of your job as a supervisor.  Why is documentation important? It’s the law: When an employee is on probation , supervisors must evaluate employees with formal reports on three separate occasions. Supervisors must also evaluate permanent employees once a year. MOUs include provisions that govern the maintenance of records. It’s fair: Employees are judged on their job performance, and performance impacts training opportunities, promotions, pay, and layoff, among other things.  If you routinely keep notes about each employee’s performance as you go along, your job will be much easier when it’s time to write probation reports and performance evaluations. If the employee's poor performance or misconduct merits a counseling memo or adverse action, your file will be evidence that supports your decision because it proves that you continuously provided timely, clear feedback and gave the employee a chance to improve. It’s your job: Departments rely on supervisors to assist every employee to be efficient, productive, and satisfied.  If you fail to maintain documentation on all of the employees you supervise, you aren’t completing a critical component of your own job and it could affect how you are evaluated. Bottom line – You cannot supervise effectively if you don’t document the job expectations along with the employee’s strengths, weaknesses, successes and failures. The Supervisor’s File: The supervisor’s file (referred to by some as a “drop file”) is the record that you keep on the employee’s work and it stays with you even when the employee moves on to another job. The supervisor’s file is an invaluable tool for completing reports, giving recognition and references, figuring out a training budget and reminding yourself of points to cover in probation reports or performance evaluations. The supervisor’s file is also your record that you have followed the rules and performed your duties as a supervisor properly.  For example, if your employee tells you that he believes that a coworker is harassing him, you have a duty to forward that information to the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Officer in your department.  You should keep a copy of your email or memo referring the matter to the EEO Officer , along with a copy of your documentation reflecting that you advised the employee about his right to file a complaint with the department’s EEO Officer. Your supervisor’s file now includes documentation that you took prompt and appropriate action to ensure that the complaint was addressed by the appropriate authorities. The supervisor’s file is different from the employee’s Official Personnel File (OPF).  The OPF is a comprehensive record of the employee’s transactional history as a state employee.  It is maintained by the HR office and follows the employee if the employee transfers to another department. A few other points about the supervisor’s file: Depending on the employee's bargaining unit, the applicable MOUs include different rules on what can be included in a supervisor’s file and the employee’s right to review it.  Always review the rules in the MOU for the specific employee. Your supervisor’s file is NOT confidential - the employee or his/her representative can see it upon request.  Keep your documentation thorough, professional, and fair.  Don’t include anything that you wouldn’t feel comfortable having the employee read or have used as evidence in a hearing. Examples of things to include: A copy of the Class Specification for the employee’s class.  The Class Specification can help you determine what duties are appropriate for an employee in this class. A duty statement for the job, with notes about any performance discussions you have with the employee. Any “expectations” memos you have given the employee, further describing their job duties or department rules. Recognition the employee has received, including compliments from customers or coworkers. Samples of work products, good and bad. Complaints about the employee and notes about how you followed-up and responded to the complaint, if appropriate. Your day-to-day notes about the employee’s performance. Your notes of any meetings or phone calls with others about the employee’s performance Notes of your conversations with the employee. Examples of things you do not need to include in a supervisor’s file: Your feelings and opinions. Stick to the facts about the quality and quantity of the employee’s work product. Speculation about what might be causing the problem behavior or what could be motivating the employee.  Again, just the facts, please. Things you wouldn’t tell the employee directly - don’t just vent in writing. Don’t include private information about the employee.  For example, the MOUs generally prohibit including anything in a supervisor’s file showing referrals for medical or psychiatric treatment. As you go through the Corrective Phase, document every step.  Again, unless the MOU provides otherwise, email yourself after every discussion, or hand write a simple note and drop it in your supervisor’s file.  And, again, discuss your options and how to approach the problem with your HR staff and your supervisor, especially if you have addressed this or a similar problem with this employee before. Counseling Memos/Letters of Correction: Progressive discipline is the overarching process that starts with corrective action and includes formal discipline.  Progressive discipline requires that when you first address an employee’s performance deficiencies, you start with a modest correction, like verbal counseling, or an informal email or memorandum documenting your conversation with the employee and the employee's agreement to improve.  If there is no improvement, the actions you take are progressively more formal and serious, from counseling memos to a formal adverse action. A formal adverse action is the final phase of progressive discipline in which the actions taken will have a negative, often financial, impact on the employee’s job status.  Adverse actions are discussed at greater length in the final section of this guidebook entitled:  Formal Adverse Action Phase.  An “adverse action” is a term of art that refers to the legal process the state employer follows to impose formal discipline on an employee and includes a penalty such as a formal letter of reprimand, a pay cut, a suspension, demotion or termination.  Every supervisor needs a basic understanding of how adverse actions happen, and what to expect from the process. Evidence of the fact that you engaged in progressive discipline is particularly important when you file a formal adverse action.  If the employee appeals the adverse action to the State Personnel Board, in reviewing whether your selected penalty is appropriate, the SPB will consider whether your department followed progressive discipline.  The SPB may reduce the penalty if the record does not reflect the department took progressive discipline that afforded the employee the opportunity to correct the poor performance. At the same time, progressive discipline does not have to go on forever. Put in practical terms, if simple verbal counseling with the employee doesn’t result in the desired improvement, the next step in progressive discipline is a counseling memorandum (counseling memo), sometimes referred to as a Letter of Correction.  A counseling memo is drafted and given to the employee with the guidance of your HR office because the memo must conform to several technical requirements to qualify as progressive discipline.  The counseling memo must include a description of the problem, a summary of any prior attempts to correct the problem, how you expect the employee to correct the problem and what the consequences will be for similar failures in the future.  And if the counseling memo doesn’t bring about the desired performance improvement, you can move on to formal adverse action. To qualify as progressive discipline which can be utilized to support the penalty in an adverse action, a counseling memo must include an advisory referred to as a Bazemore warning.  This warning consists of a scripted advisory that notifies the employee of the possibility of formal adverse action for the incidents covered in the counseling memo as well as new conduct if similar poor performance occurs in the future. The warning arose out of the Bazemore SPB decision and its progeny that established the requirement and proscribed very specific language. The Bazemore warning is a critical part of the counseling memo.  Depending on department policy, the counseling memo may be retained in the OPF and becomes part of the employee’s official personnel record for a specific period of time. The amount of time that a counseling memo may be retained in an OPF will vary depending on factors including the applicable MOU and the department’s procedures. It should be noted that if the employee problem is misconduct rather than poor performance, progressive discipline may not be necessary.  Sometimes employees can be terminated for a single act of extreme misconduct. Adverse actions in general and the requirement of progressive discipline in certain instances are discussed in more detail in the supervisor’s role in the \"Formal Adverse Action Phase” of this Guide.  Again, check with your HR office to discuss how and whether progressive discipline applies to this employee’s particular problem. Special Rules for Peace Officers and Firefighters: Some positions in state service are classified as “peace officer” positions, and the discipline process for these employees is governed by special rules.  If you supervise any of these “public safety officers,” you probably already know about POBR – the “Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights Act” beginning at Government Code 3300. State service also includes classifications that are designated as Firefighters, EMTs and Paramedics.  These classifications also have special procedures under the Firefighters Procedural Bill of Rights Act, known as FPBR, beginning at Government Code Sections 3250.  (All of these classifications are referred to as 'firefighters' pursuant to this law.) POBR and FPBR establish unique rights whenever a peace officer or firefighter is investigated or interrogated.  In general, POBR and FPBR limit when performance discussions can take place; how many supervisors can be present; the amount of time and form of the notice to be given to the employee, as well as representation rights. If a peace officer is being investigated for possible criminal misconduct and the same misconduct is the subject of a personnel or administrative investigation, the considerations are even more complicated and your HR staff and perhaps legal staff will advise you on how to pursue corrective action without violating the applicable rules. Bottom line – don’t assume you know POBR or FPBR.  Discuss the issue with your supervisor, and LR and HR staff to explain your corrective work improvement plan so they can determine whether POBR or FPBR will be triggered and ensure your plan complies with these statutes whenever you are planning to conduct a corrective counseling session with a peace officer or a firefighter. Denial of Merit Salary Adjustments: Employees are eligible for a Merit Salary Adjustment (MSA) (usually a 5% raise) until their salary has reached the maximum step of the salary range.  Be advised that an MSA will go into effect for an employee unless you take affirmative action to block it, and that this automatic MSA can make it difficult to take subsequent corrective action with an employee.  MSA’s are automatically applied to most employees unless you, the supervisor, take action to stop the MSA from going into effect.  If you have an employee with a performance problem that has not improved with ongoing corrective feedback, you need to carefully review whether permitting the MSA is appropriate. If you allow an MSA to go into effect for an employee against whom you later take adverse action during the same performance period, the employee will counter the adverse action by pointing out that his or her performance was satisfactory enough to merit an MSA .  In other words, receiving an MSA will be used as evidence that you were satisfied with the employee’s performance at the time. If you are in the process of counseling an employee and you are notified that the employee is due for an MSA, talk over your options with your HR staff  immediately because you generally have a very limited amount of time to stop the MSA from going into effect.  The applicable MOU is the source of information on how and when MSAs can be denied.  For excluded employees, the causes for denial and procedure rules are in the CalHR/SPB rules (Title 2 of the California Code of Regulations). This is another subject area where the correct approach will depend on the facts of the individual case and so your best course of action is to check with your HR office for advice and guidance. Employees denied an MSA can file a grievance under their department’s internal procedures and then file an appeal with CalHR.  (See Title 2 Section 599.684.) FORMAL ADVERSE ACTION PHASE: The Supervisor’s Role in Adverse Actions and Other Hearings: “Adverse Action” is the name of the legal process state departments follow in order to reprimand, suspend, demote, or terminate a permanent employee.  Every supervisor needs a basic understanding of how adverse actions happen, and what to expect from the process. There are other types of proceedings that can be utilized to remove an employee from state service, too, including terminations for medical reasons, and a procedure known as a “non-punitive” action when an employee loses one of the qualifications for the job.  For example, a peace officer employee who loses his or her right to carry a weapon through some legal action cannot continue in a peace officer classification. All of these procedures carry a right to appeal to the SPB, as do Rejections during Probation. This section touches briefly on what to expect in these proceedings and provides links to additional resources. Your department’s HR office, often working with legal staff, takes the lead in writing up the required documents and managing these procedures because it is the “appointing authority” or department that is authorized to change an employee’s position.  Your HR or legal staff will tell you how you can help. Whatever the type of proceeding, the supervisor is often called as a witness, and your supervisor’s file will provide critical documentation of why the action was necessary and appropriate. Why are Adverse Actions Complicated? Civil Service laws and rules permit the state employer to discipline and terminate employees with performance problems, but they also establish detailed procedures the State must follow to implement discipline.  There are a variety of reasons for these procedures: A permanent position in state service is a “property right” and under state and federal constitutional law, a person cannot be deprived of a property right without due process of law.  Due process requires the appointing authority to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing in addition to other legal rights. Government Code section 19572 establishes 24 separate and distinct grounds for taking adverse action, and each one has its own legal definition that the appointing authority has the duty to prove applies to the facts of a particular case.  In the “Notice of Adverse Action” your department will write a description of what the employee did and list which of the grounds for adverse action apply. The Statute of Limitations for adverse actions is generally three years, meaning that problems older than that generally cannot be included in the action as a legal cause for discipline.  However, for some classifications, the period is shorter, and sometimes older occurrences can be relevant when justifying the penalty. The Notice of Adverse Action has to be served on the employee at least five working days before it is effective and the employee must be given the opportunity to have a “Skelly” hearing during that time. If an employee appeals the adverse action, the employee is entitled to a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at SPB.  These administrative hearings follow procedures very similar to those used in a court of law:  parties are often represented by lawyers, witnesses provide testimony under oath, and the ALJ adheres to a set of formal rules for receiving evidence and reaching a decision. During the hearing, the employer (your department) will have the “burden of proof.”  This means the department will have to prove by a preponderance (more than 50%) of the evidence that the employee’s conduct meets the definition of one of the 24 legal reasons for discipline.  If the employee’s explanation is just as likely true as the department’s, the department will lose. Your department will also offer evidence to demonstrate that the penalty chosen is appropriate for the violation. The possible penalties are dismissal, suspension, demotion, reduction in salary, and formal reprimand.  Where applicable, your department will offer evidence of prior progressive discipline and how the employee responded to the opportunity to correct the problem.  Sometimes even if the SPB finds that the conduct occurred, the SPB may impose a lesser penalty if the ALJ or the Board thinks the department failed to engage in progressive discipline. Definitions of Common Adverse Action Terms: To  fully understand the adverse action process you need to be familiar with the following basic terms: Administrative Law Judge or “ALJ” is the hearing officer who presides over the SPB hearing.  ALJs are real judges just like the ones in the courts, and they are governed by the same code of conduct, meaning they must be impartial, thorough, studious, and professional.  During the hearing the ALJ will:  swear in witnesses; listen to testimony; rule on objections to questions or the introduction of evidence; ask his or her own questions; set the schedule for the hearing and otherwise direct the lawyers on how to proceed; and organize and manage the exhibits presented by the parties.  After the hearing, the ALJ will draft a “Proposed Decision,” which will be reviewed by the full, five member board of SPB. Appeal is the right of an employee served with an adverse action.  When an employee appeals, a hearing will be scheduled and an ALJ assigned to the case.  The department will have to present its evidence to prove the facts and allegations in the adverse action that support the penalty. ATO or Administrative Time Off applies when an employee is placed on paid leave pending a possible adverse action.  If the ATO is going to last longer than 30 days, your department will need CalHR’s approval. Burden of Proof is the standard the employer must meet to establish that the employee’s behavior meets the definition of a legal cause for adverse action.  The employer must prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence, meaning the ALJ must find it more likely than not that the department’s proof of the facts of the case is correct.  The department will also offer proof that the penalty chosen is appropriate to the problem. Causes for Adverse Action, or Grounds for Adverse Action refers to the 24 reasons to take action found in Government Code Section 19572 .  Each of the causes for adverse action has its own legal definition, and each requires the department to prove certain facts.  For example, “Insubordination” may sound the same as “Willful Disobedience” but they have distinct definitions that require slightly different proof. Nexus means connection, and it is an element of what the employer must prove in cases where the employee’s misconduct took place off-duty.  The employer must demonstrate that there is a nexus between the off-duty behavior and the employee’s ability to do his or her job.  For example, drunk driving may be job related for a Peace Officer but not for an Office Technician. Penalty is the change in the employee’s status that the employer has made with the adverse action.  For example, if the department is moving someone from one classification to a lower classification because she or he is unable to perform all of the job duties at the higher position, the penalty is demotion.  If the employee appeals the demotion, the department will have to prove that it is an appropriate penalty for the performance problem. Progressive discipline refers to the state policy enforced by the SPB that requires that performance problems must first be addressed in a manner that provides the employee notice of the problem and an opportunity to improve, and requires a department to start with less serious penalties such as a counseling memo before taking formal adverse action. Skelly Hearing is the name of the hearing the employee can ask for before the adverse action becomes effective to ensure no mistakes have been made by the department in taking the action.  This hearing is a short, more informal due process-review of the department’s case and the employee’s defense.  It is called a Skelly Hearing because the requirement was established through a court case entitled Skelly v .SPB . Steps of an Adverse Action: This is a very general overview of the steps in an adverse action.  It is designed to give you an understanding of the process.  Again, every case is different, so ask questions about what to expect in your department. 1.  Fact Gathering: Adverse actions are based on facts, so the first step is to learn and analyze the facts to determine whether there is factual basis to support an adverse action.  A department taking an adverse action will need to be able to describe what happened; who the witnesses were; when it happened; where it happened; and whether it was an isolated event or part of a continuing pattern. As the direct supervisor, your supervisor’s file is often the single best source of the facts upon which the adverse action will be based.  The corrective actions you have implemented previously will demonstrate that the department engaged in appropriate progressive discipline. Depending on the issue involved, and more commonly with misconduct, fact gathering may be necessary and can be completed either informally by the supervisor or more formally by a trained investigator.  In most departments, if the employee engaged in serious misconduct, the fact gathering is performed by someone other than the direct supervisor. Many departments have procedures and experienced personnel to direct how a particular case is developed.  Formal investigations may be conducted by an employee in your department, an employee from another department, a member of the California Highway Patrol, an investigator from CalHR, or even an attorney with a private law firm.  The investigation is always intended to establish the facts while protecting the rights of the employee and witnesses. 2.  Writing up the Legal Document, Notice of Adverse Action: The fact gathering will be used to draft the Notice of Adverse Action.  A Notice of Adverse Action must include information that is sufficiently detailed such that the employee can prepare a defense to the charges if he or she decides to appeal.  The Notice will include: What penalty is being imposed and when it is effective.  For example, “You are terminated from your position as a (Class Title) effective on Month/Day/Year. A “Statement of Causes” which lists the grounds for the adverse action, referring to subsections of Government Code Section 19572 . A “Statement of Reasons” that plainly and thoroughly states the facts on which the department is basing the action.  These are the facts that were established through the investigation or other informal fact gathering.  If the employee appeals the adverse action to the SPB, the department will have to prove the facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  The facts should meet the definition of the misconduct being charged. Facts that support the penalty that the department is imposing.  The Skelly case established not just the requirement for a Skelly hearing, but also described the factors the SPB will use to review a penalty.  Depending on the facts, the department may also need to demonstrate that Progressive Discipline was followed when disciplining this employee. Other legal requirements such as a notice of the right to a Skelly hearing, the right to appeal, the right to review documents, and the right to representation. When the Notice of Adverse Action is served on the employee, it will have all of the supporting documents attached, including the documentation you have kept in your supervisor’s file describing your performance discussions with the employee.  If the employee has violated policies, copies of the policies may be included as well. 3.  Service of the Notice on the Employee and Skelly Hearing: There are precise rules that dictate how the Notice of Adverse Action must be given to, or “served,” on the employee.  Your personnel office is responsible for ensuring that this process is implemented correctly.  The employee must be provided at least five working days before the adverse action is considered \"effective.\"  This means that the penalty will not go into effect for five working days. During those five days, or later if the parties agree, the employee is entitled to have a “Skelly Hearing” in front of an impartial manager at a higher level than the employee.  In a skelly hearing, the employee is afforded the opportunity to explain why the action is mistaken.  Generally the \"Skelly Officer\" who presides over this due process hearing is a manager who works for your department, but sometimes will come from another state department.  In the Notice of Adverse Action, the Skelly Hearing is often referred to as the “Right to Respond to Appointing Power.” The adverse action “becomes effective,” meaning the penalty is imposed, on the effective date identified in the action regardless of whether the employee requests a Skelly hearing.  Once the penalty goes into effect, it continues unless the employee settles with the department or the employee appeals and the SPB changes the level of penalty. 4.  Employee Files a Formal Appeal: The Employee has 30 calendar days from the effective date of the adverse action to make an appeal to the SPB.  Once the SPB receives the appeal, the formal hearing process begins. There may be “discovery” prior to the hearing itself when the employee can ask the department to produce records or provide the opportunity to talk to possible witnesses. For more information about the hearing process and requirements, refer to the SPB's Appeals Resource Guide. 5.  Settlement Conference: The SPB encourages the parties to settle by reaching a compromise.  The Pros and Cons of settlement will vary with each case. In a Settlement Conference, an ALJ (not the one who will ultimately hear the appeal) will work with the parties to see if the parties can agree to a resolution that will avoid the need for a hearing.  The ALJ will generally listen to both sides, point out the weaknesses in their respective cases, and encourage settlement.  But no one is required to settle, and a settlement cannot be imposed without agreement by both sides.  Settlements often involve leaving the adverse action \"on record\" but reducing the penalty or deleting certain charges. 6.  Formal Hearing: Generally, a designated department representative other than the department's lawyer (or non-lawyer advocate), will sit through the hearing to assist the department's lawyer.  Often the supervisor fills that role because the supervisor is the best source of knowledge about the employee and what happened, and therefore best able to help when the department's lawyer has a question about the testimony or other evidence. Witnesses are generally \"excluded\" from the hearing to protect their testimony from the influence, conscious or unconscious, of hearing others talk about the same incident.  However, the hearings are otherwise open to anyone who is not a witness, and sometimes the employee will bring family or other supporters. The ALJ will direct the hearing after going \"on the record\" meaning setting up the recording for the hearing.  The department presents its case first.  As the immediate supervisor, you may be called as a witness to testify to facts about the employee's conduct and prior counseling or corrective feedback you have given the employee.  Witnesses are sworn in, just like in court, and asked questions about events and documents.  After the department's representative asks you questions about the employee's performance or misconduct (direct examination), you will most likely be asked questions by the lawyer/representative for the employee as well (cross examination).  The ALJ may also direct questions to the witnesses while they are on the stand testifying. The lawyers will raise objections from time to time and the ALJ will rule on the objections.  If you are a witness when an objection is made, you will be asked not to answer the question until the objection is resolved by the Judge.  Sometimes the question will be stricken and you won't be required to answer it at all. The appellant (the employee) puts on his or her case after the department presents its evidence.  However, since the department has the burden of proof, technically the employee does not have to offer any evidence or new facts.  For example, the employee may just offer a character witness rather than trying to refute the department's witnesses with witnesses of his or her own. 7.  The Decision After the hearing concludes, the ALJ will write a “Proposed Decision.”  The format is similar to the Notice of Adverse Action. The Proposed Decision will give dates and times of the hearing, and in a “Statement of Facts” set out the facts which the ALJ has found to be more likely true than not.  In this way, conflicts in the testimony are resolved.  Then based on those facts, the ALJ will discuss the penalty and find it is either supported by the evidence and upheld it, or will modify it to some lesser penalty, or not sustain the penalty at all, meaning the department has not met its burden of proof and the adverse action will be nullified. The Proposed Decision is not a public document but is transmitted to the members of the SPB for review.  The SPB describes what happens next on its website: The Proposed Decision may sustain the action completely, modify the penalty, revoke the action, and/or restore the employee to the position and/or employment list.  The proposed decision will be reviewed by the five-member Board at one of its bi-monthly meetings. The Board may adopt the proposed decision, modify (lower) the penalty, reject the decision, and/or remand the decision to the ALJ for further findings.  If the Board rejects the proposed decision, the parties will be given an opportunity to purchase the transcript, file written argument, and present oral argument to the Board at a public meeting.  The Board will then issue its own decision in the case. 8.  After the SPB Issues Its Decision: Either the department or the employee can appeal to a California Superior Court by filing a “Writ of Administrative Mandamus.”  The Superior Court will not hold a new hearing, but instead will review the record of the SPB hearing and review the exhibits to make sure the evidence supports the final decision.  Generally SPB decisions are upheld when appealed to Superior Court, but not in every case. Other Hearings That Are Under SPB Jurisdiction: Other kinds of actions can also result in an appeal hearing or a formal legal proceeding. As with adverse actions, these are not procedures that a supervisor initiates on his or her own.  Always consult with your own supervisor and with the HR staff in your department to figure out how to handle a problem. 1. Medical Terminations : Sometimes an employee’s health will change in a way that prevents the employee from handling all of the job duties.  Most often these cases result from an injury to the employee that may impair mobility or strength required for the job.  Medical actions are very complex and often involve overarching issues related to accommodating employees with disabilities.  Generally the past performance of the employee is not an issue; the issue is whether the employee can currently perform the job.  The Supervisor’s role is more limited in these actions and HR will take the lead. 2. Non-Punitive Terminations : In these actions, the employee has lost one of the minimum qualifications for the job, and has to be removed until that qualification is restored.  For example, a nurse may lose his license to practice nursing because of an admitted substance abuse problem.  Even if that problem has not affected his work, he cannot continue to be a nurse for the State because he has lost one of the basic requirements for the classification; a nursing license.  When the license is restored the position may be as well.  Again, HR will take the lead on these actions. 3. Rejections During Probation : Probationary periods pass quickly and the documentation retained in your supervisor’s file, reflecting your performance discussions with the employee is the key evidence for rejecting an employee during probation. The law provides that an employee can be rejected during probation for reasons relating to their qualifications; for the “good of the service” and for failure to demonstrate “merit, efficiency, fitness, and moral responsibility.”  Your HR office can help you figure out if the problems you are experiencing with the employee meet the legal definitions of these terms. The probationary period is considered to be the last step of the civil service examination process and employees are not granted permanent status in their classification until they pass probation.  As a result, unlike adverse actions, in appeals from rejection on probation, the burden of proof is on the employee. Bottom line – keep an eye on the clock during the probationary period.  Use it to assess the employee’s ability to perform the job duties.  Discuss any concerns with the employee as the issues come up and document your discussions.  Document, document, document.  If you are not confident that the employee can perform the job, discuss options with your HR staff as soon as you can. The HR staff will write up the legal documentation if a Rejection is in order.

        "title": "How To Set Up a Home Network Router",
        "content": "Choose a convenient location to begin installing your router such as an open floor space or table. This does not need to be the permanent location of the device. Particularly for wireless routers, you may find it necessary to re-position the unit after installing it as the cables / signals may not reach all areas needed. At the beginning, its better to choose a location where it's easiest to work with the router and worry about final placement later. Plug in the router's electrical power source, then turn on the router by pushing the power button. (Optional) Connect your Internet modem to the router . Most network modemsconnect via an Ethernet cable but USB connections are becoming increasingly common. The cable plugs into the router jack named WAN or uplink or Internet . After connecting the cable, be sure to power cycle (turn off and turn back on) the modem to ensure the router recognizes it. Connect one computer to the router . Even if the router is a wireless model, connect this first computer to the router via a network cable. Using a cable during router installation ensures the maximum reliability of the equipment. Once a wireless router installation is complete, the computer can be changed over to a wireless connection if desired. Open the router's administration tool. From the computer connected to the router, first open your Web browser. Then enter the router's address for network administration in the Web address field and hit return to reach the router's home page. Many routers are reached by either the Web address \"http://192.168.1.1\" or \"http://192.168.0.1\" Consult your router's documentation to determine the exact address for your model. Note that you do not need a working Internet connection for this step. Log in to the router . The router's home page will ask you for a username and password. Both are provided in the router's documentation. You should change the router's password for security reasons, but do this after the installation is complete to avoid unnecessary complications during the basic setup. If you want your router to connect to the Internet, you must enter Internet connection information into that section of the router's configuration (exact location varies). If using DSL Internet, you may need to enter the PPPoE username and password. Likewise, if you have been issued a static IP address by your provider (you would need to have requested it), the static IP fields (including network mask and gateway) given to you by the provider must also must be set in the router. If you were using a primary computer or an older network router to connect to the Internet, your provider may require you to update the MAC address of the router with the MAC address of the device you were using previously. Read How to Change a MAC Address for a detailed description of this process. If this is a wireless router, change the network name (often called SSID). While the router comes to you with a network name set at the factory, you will never want to use this name on your network. Read How to Change the Router SSID for detailed instructions. Verify the network connection is working between your one computer and the router. To do this, you must confirmed that the computer has received IP addressinformation from the router. See How to Find IP Addresses for a description of this process. (If applicable) Verify your one computer can connect to the Internet properly. Open your Web browser and visit a few Internet sites such as http://compnetworking.about.com /. Connect additional computers to the router as needed. If connecting wirelessly, ensure the network name (SSID) of each is computer matches that of the router. Finally, configure additional network security features as desired to guard your systems against Internet attackers. These WiFi Home Network Security Tips offer a good checklist to follow. Tips: When connecting devices with network cables, be sure each end of the cable connects tightly. Loose cables are one of the most common sources of network setup problems. What You Need: A network router Network adapters installed on all devices to be connected to the router A working Internet modem (optional) A Web browser installed at least one computer in the network",

        "content": "Getting ready for parental leave transition planning When covering a lot of information in a Knowledge Article, for the best reading experience, try to break up text into paragraphs of no more than five lines. Vary the length of paragraphs and keep your sentences short, so your content is easier to scan. You can also use bullets, dashes, and ellipses to visually break it up. Consider providing a table of contents at the top of long articles, allowing readers to quickly skip to the information they came for. For guides on complex processes, such as this one, consider providing value to your employees by linking out to useful resources by trusted external organizations, such as publications your employees are familiar with and trust, or thought leaders in the field you’re writing about. Parental leave transition planning: what to expect When an employee takes parental leave, what happens? Usually either the coworkers of the absent employee take over their duties; a temporary employee is hired as backfill to provide coverage; or some combination of new and existing employees take on the tasks of the person who is away. For employees who perform duties that require specialized skills, training and/or expertise, a transition plan that documents the work and duties to be handed over is essential—no matter what the coverage solution is. Most companies will have a standard format for what is contained in this plan. Your manager should be able to provide you with an idea of what is expected from you to make this plan. Usually an employee going on parental leave collaborates with their manager on many aspects of the transition plan. Typically, the manager “owns” the document, as some parts of it are related to internal matters that don’t involve the employee. But other parts will likely relate directly to the employee’s projects and responsibilities, so the employee is the better person to own this portion. Often the employee will act as the “go-between” with team members who will be covering for them, working with their replacement, or both. Transition planning before your parental leave: the “transition-out” plan Several months before your expected start-of-leave date, you and your manager will likely create official written plan: your “transition-out” document… sometimes called a handover or handoff plan. Not: If your role does not require specialized training, skills, and/or experience, your transition-out plan might be very brief, containing basics of when you’ll be away and any accommodations to your work that may be needed before your time off begins. If you do have a specialized role, however, your transition-out plan will more involved. The information we’re discussing below is primarily for people with specialized roles. What to include In general, from the employee’s perspective the transition-out plan should cover the essential information you need on a day-to-day basis to do your job. It should also summarize each project you’re working on and where it stands, and contain any other details on who will be responsible for what. Coverage responsibilities—will probably be determined by you and your manager together. But if you had any conversations with your team that defined these matters in further detail, it’s a good idea to include that info in your documentation. You’ll likely have a section of the transition-out plan that contains just the basic details of your leave: your expected date of beginning leave; whether you plan to work from home at all before starting leave; and your length of leave. Even if your manager, not you, technically owns this part of the plan, be sure to check it to ensure it’s accurate. Ensure the plan allocates some time for you to be working alongside the person or people covering for you. They will probably need to get current information from you in the last few weeks before you plan to go. Think about your preferences for staying in touch during leave. Define these details in writing. Often an employee will designate a leave liaison (usually a peer or colleague) who reaches out according to a set schedule, and also can call in case of an emergency. Work with your team and manager to select this person. (Typically, it’s not required to be in touch with work while away. For many roles, it may not be helpful. But for people in some roles being reachable while you’re out is a courtesy that your team may deeply appreciate.) If you typically lead regular events or meetings, be sure to account for what will happen with them while you’re away. Will someone else lead the events (or will they be cancelled)? Who can lead them? Do they need training before you go? If you have direct reports, summarize what your system is for working with them in your transition-out plan. This gives whomever is covering for you an idea of how to operate (i.e. do you have regular meetings? Is your team fairly self-driven, or do they expect check-ins from you frequently?). Process suggestions According to the Harvard Business Review , working with your team to decide how everything will get done when you’re away can be a suprisingly positive experience. Giving your team a chance to see the way the group responds to your needs may make them feel they’d be taken care of too, if something came up. Working with your team as you plan isalso just practical... it can help ensure your transition plan is not guesswork, but rather, is based on colleagues’ actualworkloads, areas of expertise, skill sets, etc. Some people planning parental leave worry their coworkers will resent them, or blame them for heavier workloads. But remember that for some your colleagues, covering for you may actually be an opportunity: a chance to take on added responsibility and prove themselves. After you have finalized your sections of your plan, share it with the people who’ll be using it. Ask them to review it—and invite them to suggest anything else they’d like you to include. This will help your plan be thorough, and will re-emphasize your commitment to your team. Transition planning for returning from parental leave: the “transition-back” Experts at Harvard Business Review recommend a “transition-back” plan to ensure an “appropriate flow” of work. Because you probablydon’t want people to either ignore you or overload you on your first day back. It will be a resource you, your supervisor, and team can reference both before you leaveand after you return. Its purpose is to ensure you all are on the same page when it comes to what your first days and weeks will look like. What to include In this document, explain how you’ll be returning to work—something you probably previously decided with HR, and possibly your manager, but something your colleagues might not know. For instance, will you be working half-days? Or working from home some days or weeks? For non-specialized roles, the transition-back plan may be quite simple, perhaps outlining a plan for the first day and a list of meetings to have the first week. For specialized roles, this transition-back plan should include some time for handover , working alongside whomever replaced you to get current information from them. Helpful parental leave transition planning resources Planning for a smooth parental leave handoff takes time, but fortunately, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. See below for additional guidance on making parental leave work for everyone. The organization Working Families has an excellent employee’s guide (specific to maternity, but relevant to other parenting types) on their shifting needs throughout the parental leave interlude. The Gates Foundation published a white paper on parental leave. The document is oriented more toward managers—but employees might find it helpful, too; it includes extensive information on managing transitions and how to staff and plan parental leave. We’re here to help, throughout the parental leave journey. If you’d like to recommend other useful resources to include here, please let us know.",

        "title": "Managers' Transition Plan guide for Leaves of Absence",
        "content": "This is a Knowledge Article that displays for people managers only. When an employee is planning to go on parental leave—and the employee has specialized position that requires unique knowledge, skills, and/or expertise—their manager plays a central role in organizing and facilitating their smooth transition out of the office. Begin by reviewing the Knowledge Article for all employees that covers how to get ready for parental leave transitions. Working with the employee Relatively soon after the employee requests leave, managers should discuss with the employee what elements of their transition plan the employee should take the lead on. (If you aren’t familiar with what your company’s standard transition plan contains, be sure to get up to speed on it before this meeting!) Let the employee know what your process will be for finalizing the plan together. Make sure they know your organization’s policies and available leave options. As your employee is developing their transition plan, consider having conversations with them about their career. Discuss with them any post-leave pathways that they’re interested in. If appropriate, discuss with them any options they might have for training and education during their parental leave interlude that might support their career aspirations. If relevant, make sure the employee is checking with all parties that will be involved in their transition plan. Check in with these other parties yourself as well. If appropriate, as the anticipated start-of-leave date nears, work with the employee to shift them towards projects that have short-term deliverables. If appropriate, talk with the employee about what works for them to stay in touch during leave. Often an employee will designate a leave liaison, usually a peer or colleague, who actively reaches out to the employee on a set schedule outlined in the plan. Coverage & backfill The Gates Foundation recommends that managers develop coverage solutions based on the specific priorities, goals, and critical deadlines of the employee who’s leaving. (You’ll probably need to work with the employee to deeply understand these factors). If you need to initiate any recruiting processes to hire someone for backfill, make sure you give yourself enough time. You’ll need to review candidates, make a hire, and train them so they can work with the departing employee on handover items. Creating a “transition-back” plan for an employee returning from parental leave Managers should work with employees to help them define what their first days and weeks back at work will look like. Timing Typically this process starts before leave begins, when the employee and manager agree on a “transition-back” document including basic details like the return-to-work date, and any flexible methods to phase in a return-to-work that the employee may be using. These may include working from home, working half days, or taking their parental leave intermittently throughout the year of their child’s arrival. But the manager will likely revisit the return-to-work plan again a few weeks before the employee’s scheduled return date and add details. They’ll need to find out what the employee may be working on when they return (some employees shift roles significantly when they return from parental leave), and get equipment for them to use when they’re back, as well as re-activate any credentialing or facilities access that may have been turned off. Usually companies provide a template to follow for what to do the week back from a leave of absence. But you’ll likely want to schedule a light meeting on the employee’s first day back, just to say hello. In that meeting you can also plan another chat for later in the week, for the two of you to make a plan to have them ramp back up. Other considerations The organization Working Families has an excellent guide to managing parental leave for families; in it, they mention that managers can have weekly meetings with the employee for the first month of the employee’s return to work—thus providing the newly-returned employee with structure and a chance to give feedback on what is and isn’t working so far. Managers can also take steps to ensure that the recently-returned employee is not overwhelmed in their first weeks. One way to do this is by making sure the employee builds in time for handover briefings, if relevant. While these meetings may technically not have any outputs, they can be an essential part of phasing back in.",

Windows 8.x is designed for using touch, mouse, and keyboard together, on hardware ranging from touch-enabled tablets and laptops to PCs and all-in-one computers, including those without touch capability.  To decide whether to upgrade, consider details surrounding system requirements, versions, features related to your own use, and support at IU. Features Another noticeable difference is the requirement of a Microsoft account to download apps from the Windows Store and access apps such as Calendar, Mail, and Messaging. By most accounts, Windows 8.x improves performance in areas such as speed, memory management, and power efficiency, resulting in faster boot times, smaller memory footprint, and more free memory for the programs you run. Windows 8.x also suspends apps and desktop programs when a device is put into sleep mode, allowing the CPU to drop into a lower-power state for battery savings. The Task Manager and Explorer have been enhanced, allowing easier views of system resource use, and more useful and functional file management. Windows 8.x comes with improved recovery options, including restoring a device to a clean install state, or performing the equivalent of a factory reset while keeping installed apps and preferences. Both these functions can be performed from a built-in recovery menu. System Requirements Computers currently running Windows 7 should not have problems running Windows 8.x.

        "content": "Employee Stock Purchase Program—Common Questions An Employee Stock Purchase Program, or “ESPP”, is a company-run program that allows employees to purchase company shares at a discounted price. Employees contribute to the plan through payroll deductions that accumulate between the offering date and the purchase date. The company provides this program to allow eligible employees to acquire an equity interest in the company at a discount. This is a template for a FAQ Knowledge article that addresses common questions about ESPP for employees. You can use this to inform a format and the content that answer questions about ESPP as it relates to your own company. Here is an example of how common questions and answers may be formatted in a knowledge article. Table of Contents How does an ESPP plan work? What is the discounted purchase price (aka lookback)? Who is eligible to participate in the plan? What is an offering period, purchase period, or open enrollment period? How do I enroll in the ESPP plan? How do the payroll deductions work? I have questions about ESPP. What should I do? How does an ESPP plan work? When you are enrolled in ESPP, the amount you designate toward the ESPP will be deducated from your regular paychecks during the offering period. At the end of the offering period, stock will be purchased for you using those funds. The purchase price of the stock is a discounted rate. What is the discounted purchase price (aka lookback)? Shares bought under the ESPP program have a purchase price at a % discount based on the lower of the following: The “fair market value” of a share on the offering date for the applicable offering period. This is the first date of the Offering Period, also known as the grant date. The “fair market value” of a share on the applicable Purchase Date in the applicable Offering Period. The “fair market value” on an offering date will the closing price of the common stock as quoted on the stock exchange on the offering date or purchase date. Who is eligible to participate in the plan? You are eligible to participate if: You meet the minimum amount of hours worked per week, and for more than the minimum amount of months per year You don’t already won more than the maximum amount of outstanding stock in the company or one of its subsidiaries You’re employed by the company or a participating corporation And, you satisfy other eligibility requirements that may be established by the Committee If you leave the company during an active offering period, the amount you have contributed thus far will be refunded in your final paycheck. If your last day at the company is on the date of the purchase date, the company will still use your contribution amount towards the purchase of shares. What is an offering period, a purchase period or open enrollment period? An ‘offering period’ or ‘purchase period’ is the time during which payroll deductions are accumulated. An open enrollment period is the window during which you can enroll in or modify your enrollment in the ESPP. How do I enroll in the ESPP plan? You can enroll in ESPP during an ESPP open enrollment window. The ESPP open enrollment window dates are listed below. Should you have issues with enrolling online, please reach out to a bank representative during the applicable enrollment period. How do the payroll deductions work? You may increase or decrease the level of your payroll deductions for any subsequent offering period by changing your contribution amount during an ESPP open enrollment window online through your brokerage account. You may make changes to decrease the level of your payroll deductions only once during an active offering period. Once you decrease your contribution amount during an active offering period, the new rate will continue for the remainder of the offering period unless you withdraw from ESPP. Login to your brokerage account to make these changes. Your payroll deductions will begin on the first payday following the first business day of the Offering Period in which you are enrolled.

        "content": "Here are a collection of tips to help monitor and troubleshoot Conference Bridge usage.  This is meant to be supporting documentation to the other blog entries posted here about Meet-Me Conferencing and Conference Bridges. Dependency Records So, imagine you are troubleshooting an issue related to a conference bridge, but you're unsure which media resource groups could potentially use it.  Instead of searching through each media resource group and seeing which CFBs are associated, simply use the CUCM feature, \"Dependency Records\".   The link for Dependency Records will be available on the conference bridges configuration page.  This will tell you exactly which media resource groups are using a specific conference bridge. Monitoring Conference Bridge Usage in RTMT The Real Time Monitoring Tool perfmon counters for conference bridges (IP Voice Media Streaming Application) allow you to monitor: CFBConferencesActive :  This counter represents the number of active (currently in use) conferences. CFBConferencesTotal :  This counter represents the total number of conferences that started since the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service started. CFBConnectionsLost :  This counter represents the total number of times since the last restart of the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application that a Cisco Unified CallManager connection was lost. CFBConnectionState :  For each Cisco Unified CallManager that is associated with a SW Conference Bridge, this counter represents the current registration state to Cisco Unified CallManager; 0 indicates no registration to Cisco Unified CallManager; 1 indicates registration to the primary Cisco Unified CallManager; 2 indicates connection to the secondary Cisco Unified CallManager (connected to Cisco Unified CallManager but not registered until the primary Cisco Unified CallManager connection fails). CFBStreamsActive :  This counter represents the total number of currently active simplex (one direction) streams for all conferences. Each stream direction counts as one stream. In a three-party conference, the number of active streams equals 6. CFBStreamsAvailable :  This counter represents the remaining number of streams that are allocated for the conference bridge that are available for use. This counter starts as 2 multiplied by the number of configured connections (defined in the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming App service parameter for Conference Bridge, Call Count) and is reduced by one for each active stream started. CFBStreamsTotal :  This counter represents the total number of simplex (one direction) streams that connected to the conference bridge since the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service started. Conference Bridge Traces in CUCM Cisco Unified Communications Manager writes all errors for conference bridges to the Local SysLog Viewer in the Real Time Monitoring Tool. In Cisco Unified Serviceability, you can set traces for the Cisco IP Voice Media Streaming Application service (using Trace Configuration); to troubleshoot most issues, you must choose the Significant or Detailed option for the service, not the Error option. After you troubleshoot the issue, change the Debug Trace Level back to the Error option. How to See Conference Bridge Logs To quickly see the trace and debug information being generated in the previous section, connect to the CUCM's CLI and issue the following commands: file list activelog cm/trace/cms/sdi/*.txt file get activelog cm/trace/cms/sdi/*.txt file view activelog cm/trace/cms/sdi/cms00000000.txt file tail activelog cm/trace/cms/sdi/cms00000000.txt",

        "content": "Installing the ACI Fabric Hardware ACI Fabric Topology The ACI fabric topology includes the following major components: Application Centric Infrastructure Controllers (APICs) (UCS C220-M3S servers) Leaf switches (Nexus 93128TX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches) Spine switches (Nexus 9336PQ, 9504, and 9508 switches) As shown in the following figure, each APIC is connected to one or two leaf switches and each leaf switch is connected to every spine switch in the same ACI fabric. Figure 1. ACI Fabric Topology Connecting the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Depending on the type of Virtual Interface Card (VIC) installed on the controller, you must connect either optical (10-Gigabit SFP+) or copper (10BASE-T) leaf switches as follows: Controller with a VIC1225 (10-Gigabit SFP+ optical ports) module must be connected to leaf switches with 10-Gigabit SFP+ optical downlink ports (for example, a Nexus 9396PX switch). Controller with a VIC1225T (10GBASE-T ports) module must be connected to leaf switches with 10GBASE-T downlink ports (for example, a Nexus 93128TX or 9396TX switch). The connections between leaf and spine switches are made with 40-Gigabit Ethernet transceivers. Before You Begin The Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), a UCS C220-M3S server, must be fully installed in its rack and powered up (see the UCS C220 Server Installation and Service Guide ). One or two leaf switches (such as the Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, or 9396TX switches) must be installed in racks that are within reach of the interface cables that you are using to connect those switches to the controller. To install these switches in racks, see the following documents: Nexus 93128TX ACI-Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide Nexus 9396PX ACI-Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide Nexus 9396TX ACI-Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide One or more spine switches (such as the Nexus 9336PQ, 9504, or 9508) must be installed in racks that are within reach of the interface cables that you are using to connect those switches to the leaf switches. To install these switches in racks, see the following documents: Nexus 9336PQ Switch Hardware Installation Guide Nexus 9504 ACI-Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide Nexus 9508 ACI-Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide Step 1 Connect each APIC in the same ACI fabric to one (required minimum) or two (recommended for redundancy) leaf switches as follows: On the APIC, connect a 10-Gigabit or 10GBASE-T interface cable to one of the two virtual interface card (VIC) ports. VIC 1225 (module with optical ports)—You can connect this module to optical ports on leaf switches (for example, the Nexus 9396PX switch) using the SFP+ transceivers and cables listed for the Nexus 9000 Series (Fixed 9300) ACI mode at http:/​/​www.cisco.com/​c/​en/​us/​support/​interfaces-modules/​transceiver-modules/​products-device-support-tables-list.html . VIC 1225T (module with copper ports)—You can connect this module to BASE-T ports on leaf switches (for example, the Nexus 93128TX or 9396TX switches) using a 10-Gigabit interface cable with RJ-45 connectors. Connect the other end of the interface cable to a downlink port on a leaf switch. The leaf switch that you connect to depends on the VIC and interface cable used as follows: If using a VIC 1225 module with an optical cable and transceivers, connect the other end of the cable to a Nexus 9396PX leaf switch downlink port. If using a VIC 1225T with a copper cable and RJ-45 connectors, connect the other end of the cable to a Nexus 93128TX or 9396TX leaf switch downlink port. If you are connecting the APIC to an additional leaf switch, repeat Steps 1a and 1b for that connection. Step 2 Connect each leaf switch to each of the spine switches in the same ACI fabric as follows: Connect a 40-gigabit interface cable to an active uplink optical port on the leaf switch. Active ports have a lit (white) ACT LED below them. On the Nexus 93128TX switch, there are eight active uplink ports (leftmost eight uplink ports). On the Nexus 9396PX and 9396TX switches, there are 12 active uplink ports. For a list of the supported transceivers for the leaf and spine switches, see the listing for N9K-X9736PQ I/O modules installed in a Nexus 9000 Series (Modular 9500) ACI Mode switch at http:/​/​www.cisco.com/​c/​en/​us/​support/​interfaces-modules/​transceiver-modules/​products-device-support-tables-list.html ): Connect the other end of the interface cable to an optical 40-gigabit interface port on a spine switch. If connecting to a Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch, connect the interface cable to a port on a N9K-X9736PQ I/O module installed on the switch. For information on setting up the optional console and management connections or initializing the ACI fabric, see the API Fabric Getting Started Guide .",

In these cases, reimbursement of up to $50 per day will be made for baby-sitting charges which may be incurred due to your travel provided that the services are not rendered by a family member. A limitation of two trips not to exceed ten days combined is allowed. Any additional travel that may be required will be considered and is at the discretion of the Company. Arrangements for these trips should receive prior approval by Human Resources, and all accommodations should be booked through the in house travel department.

With prior approval, the mileage allowance may be applied to commercial shipment of the automobile(s). Sale of Residence by Employee If you choose to sell your primary residence, you will be reimbursed for the following costs, including but not limited to: Real estate commission (limited to prevailing local rate, but not to exceed seven percent (7%). If you should sell your home without a real-estate agent, you will receive 2% of the selling price as a bonus. One real estate appraisal (to be arranged by the relocation company). Reasonable attorney’s fees. Real estate transfer taxes. Title survey costs. Legally required inspection fees (if paid by seller). In cases where seller discount points are required for FHA or VA loans, the Company will pay half (1/2) of the seller discount points required. No reimbursement will be allowed for cleaning, maintenance, or repair costs. Purchase of New Residence by Employee If you previously owned a primary residence and you choose to purchase a residence to be used as your primary residence at the new location, you will be reimbursed for customary buying cost, including but not limited to: Reasonable attorney’s fees.

Reimbursement for Loss of Security Deposit If you are a renter, you will be reimbursed for penalties associated with early lease termination of a rented apartment or house, not to exceed one (1) month’s rent, after attempts by you and the Company have failed to have the penalty waived. Miscellaneous Relocation Allowance To help you offset the cost of the many miscellaneous costs incurred in a relocation, you will receive a lump-sum payment equal to 100% of the new monthly assignment salary up to a maximum of $6,000. This allowance is provided to you in a lump-sum payment once final approval by management for the relocation is received. This payment offers you the flexibility to use the funds for interim living and other incidental moving expenses as listed below. Examples of expenses for which this allowance is provided are as follows: Interim living expenses at the new location, including meals and lodging, until the new residence is occupied. Car rental, laundry, telephone and other incidental expenses incurred during interim living. Charges for disconnection, reinstallation and/or alteration of draperies, carpets, television antennas, etc. All incremental costs for all special service requested by the transferee, as outlined under Movement of Household Goods. New automobile license plates and drivers’ licenses required as a result of an interstate move. Telephone installation charges. Cleaning costs at the former residence and any cleaning cost which may be incurred at the new residence. Conversion of television set frequencies, retuning of piano. Interest charges on bridging loans personally obtained by new employee. All structural changes and/or repairs to the new residence. Receiving the Miscellaneous Relocation Allowance in a lump-sum permits you to manage the amount to your best advantage in paying for such expenses. No amount in addition to this lump-sum (other than specifically called for in other sections of the Relocation Policy) will be provided. Income Tax Adjustment Many of the items reimbursed or paid to you under this policy are considered taxable income. The total sum of these items subject to taxation will be determined and that amount will be “grossed-up” at a flat rate of 34%. This adjustment applies toward applicable state and federal payroll taxes. Other Items In addition to the above reimbursable items, the Company has arranged for the following services to be provided to you free of charge: employee information package on the new area, telephone counseling, relocation kits, realtor and rental assistance, home marketing assistance, spousal employment assistance, and assistance in finding other special services (i.e., child care, special medical facilities, elder care, etc.). Before any reimbursement is made under this policy, you will be required to sign a Promissory Note requiring you to reimburse the Company for any relocation expenses paid if you should voluntarily leave the employment of the Company or be released from employment for cause, including poor performance, within twelve (12) months of relocating.

OBJECTIVE To provide financial and administrative relocation assistance to a salaried exempt employee in order to maximize their performance and minimize their inconvenience during the relocation. SCOPE OF POLICY This policy applies to exempt employees who are required to relocate because they are being permanently transferred (for no less than 12 months) at the Company’s request to a location within the Company (within the United States [including possessions and territories] and Canada) that is at least fifty (50) miles farther from their residence than their former job location. Reimbursement for relocation will be limited to expenses enumerated below incurred by the employee and legally-recognized, immediate family members who currently live with the employee. Eligibility must be approved by the supervising manager, functional Vice President and Human Resources Department. Prior written approval is required for exceptions to this policy, either in determining eligibility or extent of coverage. This prior written approval must be obtained from the Human Resources Department. Benefits under the plan will cease if the employee resigns his/her employment or is terminated for cause, including for poor performance. In addition, if an employee resigns from his/her employment, or is terminated for cause, including for poor performance, within 12 months of having been transferred, the employee will be required to reimburse the Company for relocation expenses paid for by the Company under this policy. Nothing in this policy should be construed as a contract for employment for any period of time or as altering the at-will nature of the employment relationship. The Company has the right to terminate employees for any or no reason at all, at any time. This plan is administered by the Human Resources Department. The Company will not be responsible for any action taken which is beyond the scope of this plan. GENERAL POLICY An employee will be eligible to have his/her relocation expenses reimbursed after relocating to a new job location that is at least fifty (50) miles farther than his/her former residence was to his former job location. Relocated employees shall submit, in reasonable detail, vouchers for all expenses incurred to the Human Resources Department for approval and reimbursement. All relocation related expenses should be filed separately from other types of reimbursable business expenses and should be clearly marked “Relocation Expenses.” It is not the intent of the Company to provide an upgrade in housing (e.g., move from rental to ownership of residence, purchase of home with substantial adjoining land, purchase of multiple unit residence, etc.) for relocating employees. Employees to be relocated should be made fully aware of the contents of this policy. Any questionable expenses should be resolved with the Director of Human Resources before the expense is incurred. Because relocation involves many aspects, any exceptions to this policy requires the prior approval of the Director of Human Resources. APPROVALS All requests of employee relocation must be approved by the supervising manager, functional Vice President, and the Human Resource Department prior to actual relocation or commitment to the employee. In addition, any exceptions to this policy require the prior written approval of the Human Resources Department. The Relocation Expense Estimate form must be approved prior to relocation expenses incurred.",

If however, the candidate sent their resume more than a year ago, the referral applies. Employee referrals are considered “active” for one year after which another referral is required in order to be considered for an award. Payment Fifty percent (50%) of the award is paid in the pay period following the referral’s start date and the other fifty percent (50%) is paid after he/she completes six months of employment (see detailed payment schedule posted here).

The interface introduced with Vista, Windows Aero, uses 3D graphics and other high-end visual effects. System requirements The minimum hardware requirements for Windows 7 as specified by Microsoft are listed as follows: 1 GHz 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor UITS recommends: A dual-core (Core 2) processor 1 GB of system memory (32-bit) or 2 GB of system memory (64-bit) UITS recommends: 2 GB system memory A graphics processor that is DirectX 9-capable with Hardware Pixel Shader v2.0 and WDDM Driver support 128 MB of graphics memory UITS recommends: 256 MB graphics memory; non-integrated video card 40 GB of hard drive capacity with 16 GB free space (32-bit) or 20 GB free space (64-bit) UITS recommends: 80-100 GB capacity DVD-ROM drive Audio output capability Internet access capability Windows 7 versions and upgrades The different versions and upgrades include Windows 7 Ultimate; IU departments will use Windows 7 Enterprise. If you are using any version of Windows 7 or Vista except Enterprise, you can upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate. For example, if you purchase a new computer from an outside retailer, it might be shipped with Windows 7 Home Premium; you can upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate if you wish. Departments that use Vista Enterprise can upgrade to Windows 7 Enterprise. If you have Vista Enterprise for personal use, you cannot upgrade that to Windows 7 Enterprise, but you can do a clean install of Windows 7 Ultimate, which will format your hard drive and remove your previous version of Windows. For all other versions of Windows, migrating to Windows 7 will require a clean install. Your upgrade path must be consistent with your system type (i.e., you cannot upgrade from Windows Vista Ultimate 32-bit to Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, or from a 64-bit to a 32-bit operating system).",

        "content": "The farther away from the router you go, the weaker the wireless signal will be. Try moving closer to the router to see if the connection improves. Keep the router in the most central spot in the home and away from anything that might block its signal such as metal objects, bodies of water, reinforced concrete walls, foil-insulated walls, and other similar construction materials may severely weaken a wireless signal passing through it. The more devices that are sharing the wireless network, the less bandwidth is available for each device to use.  One or two devices may be 'hogging' bandwidth.  Try disconnecting some of the devices to improve performance on other devices. All devices with an antenna are trying to send data over the air. Cordless phones, baby monitors, Bluetooth devices (i.e. wireless speakers, mouse) and neighboring wireless networks are all competing with the wireless network. Move Wi-Fi devices away from other transmitting devices, or turn them off when not in use. For routers with antennas mounted on the outside of the casing, try adjusting the orientation of the antennas for maximum performance. For more modern routers with the antennas mounted internally, it is often best to mount the router vertically rather than horizontally, by using the special feet/brackets shipped with it. Some cable modems may create interference with the router, so it is best to place the router at least 3 feet away from the modem.",

        "content": "Manager Guide to Parental Leave Your employees will come to you with questions about parental leave. We’ve highlighted some of the most common questions that employees have on the company’s parental leave policy below. You should know the answers to these questions. It’s also a good idea to review articles on transition planning. Parental Leave Policy FAQ Q: What is the company’s Parental Leave Policy? A: We are committed to a healthy work/family balance, gender equality and the ability of every parent to spend quality time with the people that matter most. View our complete policy attached to this article. Q: How do I know if I can take parental leave? A: In general, you can take parental leave if you need time off related to the birth of your child or the placement of an adopted or foster child within your home. (You also have to be an employee with us.) In some regions there may be legislation that affects your eligibility. Q: How much time off would I get for parental leave? A: How much time to expect for your parental leave can vary based on parenting type, what leave entitlements apply, and other factors. You will want to consider your and your partner’s needs and preferences, such as the childcare support you have available. Finally, think about whether you’d like to take additional unpaid time on top of paid leave, and how doing so might affect your team. HR will walk you through what options you have once you start your leave request. Q: Once my child arrives, do I need to take my parental leave within a certain amount of time? A: Typically you can take parental leave within a 12-month period following the birth or adoption of your child, and may take the leave you’re entitled to either at once or in intervals. However, your company policy, applicable laws, and other factors may affect this. Check with HR to see if any other restrictions apply. Q: Can I apply unused sick days and vacation time towards my paid parental leave time? A: Yes, usually this is permitted. Q: If I have or adopt twins or multiples, or have a C-section, do I get more paid parental leave time? A: Your amount of leave time may be affected by these circumstances, depending on the laws that apply to you based on where you live and work. Q: What happens to my benefits while I’m out on parental leave? A: Your benefits will remain the same. However, if you receive your benefits through your company, you’ll need to continue to make your monthly contribution to maintain your eligibility. You can visit your Benefits Portal to review those requirements. Q: If my employment relationship with the company ends while I am on parental leave, is the company required to pay out unused leave days? A: Depending on your company policy and applicable laws, you may be entitled to compensation, but in other cases, unused parental leave is not compensable. Check with your HR representative to understand what may apply to your situation. Q: What is the process for requesting and taking parental leave? A: Start by notifying your supervisors. Notify HR through the employee portal, the virtual agent, or the HR service desk. Follow their instructions to submit your parental leave request and provide supporting documents according to the information your HR contact will provide, depending on your circumstances. Well before your expected first day of leave, you should work with your manager to hand off projects and transfer knowledge. You will be notified that you should set up a meeting with HR or your third-party leave administrator to draft a tentative leave plan. As part of this plan, consider whether you want to start parental leave before or after your child arrives (if that option is available to you) and whether you’d like to take your parental leave all at once or intermittently. Also consider what your plan is for returning. Most people have some kind of phased return, whether this means working 3-4 day weeks, working from home or part-time.",

        "title": "Dealing with Spyware and Viruses ",
        "content": "Dealing with Spyware/Adware Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.) These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer's software and/or networking protocol. Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses According to Webster's Collegiate Dictionary , a computer virus is \"a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)\". Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control. Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs. Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus. Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term \"Trojan\" to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program. Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware/Adware from your computer: Preventing Spyware / Adware Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and \"Read Me\" files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa's latest version cannot be installed without Spyware/Adware. Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally. Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose Close or select the active window and use Alt + F4 on your keyboard. Removing SpyWare / Adware Many Spyware/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft's AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See \"Obtaining Technical Assistance\" below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive.",

Next to “Standard Font,” you can select the default font type and size. After you click OK , quit Excel to apply the changes. Defining the print area so that document fits on one page If you are unable to print the desired area of the spreadsheet on a single page, t he print area may be defined incorrectly, or it may need to be specified. Click and drag the mouse to draw a selection box around the cells that should be printed. In the file menu, highlight \"Print Area\" and select \"Set Print Area.\" This will surround the cells with a dashed line. Cells that fall outside the print area will be moved to the next page. To clear an existing print area definition, highlight \"Print Area\" in the file menu, and select \"Clear Print Area.\" The maximum size of the user-defined print area depends on the margins of the page. To change the margins, select \"Page Setup\" in the file menu, and click on the \"Margins\" tab. To fit a large area onto a single page, it may be necessary to adjust the scaling of the printed output. To change the scaling, select \"Page Setup\" in the file menu, and click on the \"Page\" tab. The output can be scaled by an arbitrary factor, or it can be automatically fit to one or more pages. I'm getting an error when trying to open an Excel file. Some users may get errors when opening files with macros in Excel X for Macintosh. Those whose User folders are being stored on a volume other than the startup volume are most likely to be affected. This has been affecting some people trying to submit the Excel-based academic HR forms, which are Excel-based. Deleting the preference file \"Office Registration Cache X\" often fixes the problem: Quit any programs you have running, especially any parts of the Office suite (Excel, Word, etc.) Go to Go > Home > Library > Preferences > Microsoft . Locate the file Office Registration Cache X and drag it to the trash. ( Note: Don't empty the trash just yet.) Try opening the Excel form again. If it still doesn't work, repeat steps 1-4 and then continue: Open up TextEdit (found under Go > Applications ) and create a new document by pressing <command> +n . Go to File > Save As... . Name the file Office Registration Cache X . ( Note: Be sure to get the spelling and capitalization exactly.) Save it under Home > Library > Preferences > Microsoft . Note: There are actually two libraries: one under the user's Home and one under the Macintosh HD. Be sure to use the one under Home. The exact name of user's Home is the short name of the user's local account on their Macintosh, and it will have a house icon. You can select home by pressing command - shift -h in the Save As dialogue box. Quit TextEdit. Go back to Go > Home > Library > Preferences . Click once on Office Registration Cache X to select it, and then go to File > Get Info . Check the box for Locked . Try the file again.",

        "content": "Sample Knowledge Article–Checklist–Talking with your manager about parental leave The best checklists are brief—otherwise, they can be intimidating. An alternative to a checklist is a regular Knowledge Article; just use descriptive section headers and keep the paragraphs short. How to discuss your parental leave with your manager Here’s a checklist to help you get ready to share your parental leave news with your manager: Review your leave rights and options . These can usually be found in your company’s parental leave policy and in your benefits information. HR should also have directed you to a source of information outlining the laws that affect your rights; usually these laws govern people who live and/or work in a certain area, so there may be national and more local ones to know. Ask HR any questions on how your leave policy and benefits apply to you. Just call or set up a meeting If you’re the birthing parent , ask your doctor about any health and safety risks you’re exposed to at work that may indirectly pose risks to your developing child. Ask friends and colleagues who are parents what leave options worked for them—and why. Decide when you will tell your manager. Many people set it up for after the baby’s first trimester. But if you’re missing work often for reasons tied to parenting, sooner may be better. Schedule the meeting . Go somewhere with privacy, where you’ll feel comfortable—over coffee can be great. Plan the conversation. Have an estimate ready of dates you’ll be away. You may want to suggest how you’ll tell coworkers. If you’d like to negotiate leave terms, plan your approach. Write out your main discussion points —and refer to them during the meeting, if you’d like. Take notes during your meeting, or summarize it for yourself afterwards. That way, you can easily refer to all the key details in one place later on. If you and your manager normally email each other, you can send a note to thank them after the meeting (and review in writing what you agreed on) . This is an effective way to document key information.",

        "content": "Warranty coverage details for SCI and DeSC computers Your newly acquired Dell computer comes with a limited factory warranty of 5 years for parts and labor coverage. The warranty begins the day the computer is shipped, not when you receive it. If you think that you have a hardware problem and are not sure, please call the OIT Help Desk at 8-HELP. A Help Desk representative will determine if the problem is caused by hardware or software. If it is determined to be a hardware problem, a Hardware Support technician will be dispatched to your office to repair your computer. What Are CRUs? The Dell laptops come with many CRUs (customer replaceable units). Dell does not reimburse HWS for any work done on these items. If you suspect one of these components has failed and the Help Desk, your SCAD representative or STC representative has determined your trouble to be hardware failure, you will need to contact Dell - please see the Hardware Support warranty page for information on numbers to call. The following are examples of CRUs: Floppy Drive/LS-120/Zip drive External Floppy Drive Cable External Media Cable External Media Sleeve CD-ROMs/CD-RW/DVD drive PCMCIA Card Main Battery Travel Module AC Adapter Power Cord Mini PCI Card Assembly Memory Modules Additionally, Dell desktop systems also have CRUs. Again these are not reimbursable to Hardware Support and are dealt with by the customers also. Computer Replaceable Units are: Keyboards Mice Monitors External Speakers If one of these items needs to be replaced, you can contact Dell directly. Have your system tag number ready. When you contact Dell, they will make arrangements to have replacement parts advance shipped directly to you for immediate replacement. A return prepaid air bill will be provided for the return of your defective part. If a customer does NOT want to deal with Dell, Hardware Support can certainly obtain these items under warranty and replace them for a labor charge. Hardware Support provides service for all computers regardless of their warranty. For information regarding services and pricing for warrantied and non-warrantied computers, please see the Hardware Support warranty page.",

        "content": "Installing the Eclipse Plugin Android offers a custom plugin for the Eclipse IDE, called Android Development Tools (ADT). This plugin provides a powerful, integrated environment in which to develop Android apps. It extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android projects, build an app UI, debug your app, and export signed (or unsigned) app packages (APKs) for distribution. Note: If you have been using Eclipse with ADT, be aware that Android Studio is now the official IDE for Android, so you should migrate to Android Studio to receive all the latest IDE updates. For help moving projects, see Migrating to Android Studio . You should install the ADT plugin only if you already have an Eclipse installation that you want to continue using. Your existing Eclipse installation must meet these requirements: Eclipse 3.7.2 (Indigo) or greater Note: Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) is no longer supported with the latest version of ADT. Eclipse JDT plugin (included in most Eclipse IDE packages) JDK 6 (JRE alone is not sufficient) Not compatible with GNU Compiler for Java (gcj) Download the ADT Plugin To add the ADT plugin to Eclipse: Start Eclipse, then select Help > Install New Software . Click Add , in the top-right corner. In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter \"ADT Plugin\" for the Name and the following URL for the Location : https : //dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/ Note: The Android Developer Tools update site requires a secure connection. Make sure the update site URL you enter starts with HTTPS. Click OK . In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click Next . In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. Click Next . Read and accept the license agreements, then click Finish . If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of the software can't be established, click OK . When the installation completes, restart Eclipse. Configure the ADT Plugin Once Eclipse restarts, you must specify the location of your Android SDK directory: In the \"Welcome to Android Development\" window that appears, select Use existing SDKs . Browse and select the location of the Android SDK directory you recently downloaded and unpacked. Click Next . Your Eclipse IDE is now set up to develop Android apps, but you need to add the latest SDK platform tools and an Android platform to your environment. To get these packages for your SDK, continue to Adding Platforms and Packages . Troubleshooting ADT Installation If you are having trouble downloading the ADT plugin after following the steps above and you are behind a firewall (such as a corporate firewall), make sure that you have properly configured your proxy settings in Eclipse. In Eclipse, you can configure proxy information from the main Eclipse menu in Window (on Mac OS X, Eclipse ) > Preferences > General > Network Connections . If you are still unable to use Eclipse to download the ADT plugin as a remote update site, you can download the ADT zip file to your local machine and manually install it: Download the ADT Plugin zip file (do not unpack it): Package Size MD5 Checksum ADT-23.0.6.zip 103344298 bytes f64b7e50c84799f41c642218c35f1bbe Start Eclipse, then select Help > Install New Software . Click Add , in the top-right corner. In the Add Repository dialog, click Archive . Select the downloaded ADT-23.0.6.zip file and click OK . Enter \"ADT Plugin\" for the name and click OK . In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click Next . In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. Click Next . Read and accept the license agreements, then click Finish . If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of the software can't be established, click OK . When the installation completes, restart Eclipse. To update your plugin once you've installed using the zip file, you will have to follow these steps again instead of the default update instructions. Other install errors Note that there are features of ADT that require some optional Eclipse packages (for example, WST). If you encounter an error when installing ADT, your Eclipse installation might not include these packages. For information about how to quickly add the necessary packages to your Eclipse installation, see the troubleshooting topic ADT Installation Error: \"requires plug-in org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui\" . For Linux users If you encounter this error when installing the ADT Plugin for Eclipse: An error occurred during provisioning . Cannot connect to keystore . JKS ...then your development machine lacks a suitable Java VM. Installing Sun Java 6 will resolve this issue and you can then reinstall the ADT Plugin.",

Zoho services started coming back online for customer use at 3:49 pm, and all services were fully restored at 6:22 pm PST. We absolutely realize how important our services are for businesses and users who rely on us; we let you down on Friday. Please accept our humblest apologies. The cause of the outage was an abrupt power failure in our state-of-the-art collocated data center facility (owned and operated by Equinix) in the Silicon Valley area, California. Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened abruptly , with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5+ years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday. They restored power quickly, but the damage was done because of the abruptness of the outage.",

        "title": "How to Set Up a Broadband Router",
        "content": "If you have recently purchased a router and have concerns that the instruction manual is for PCs, don't panic. Many router manuals show the Windows OS only although the router works across platforms. To spare you the somewhat annoying task of translating the manual into Mac language, we're providing Mac-specific instructions. We recommend that you print out this article before you begin setting up your router, so you can have a copy in front of you while you are setting up your connection. This step-by-step article shows setup of the Linksys EtherFast router, which we rated highly in our review of Broadband Internet Routers. However, you can use the same instructions to set up any of the routers in the review. Step 1: Connect Your Broadband Modem to the Router Using a standard Category 5 Ethernet cable, plug in your cable or DSL modem to the port on the router marked WAN, or Internet, as shown above. Step 2: Connect the Router to Your Computer(s) Connect another Ethernet cable (it's the red one in the diagram above) from the router's LAN port to each computer, or to your network's Ethernet hub. If we were to connect this one-port router to a network, the red cable would connect to an Ethernet hub (not pictured) using the hub's Uplink port. Then the other Ethernet cables on the hub would connect to each computer in the network. TIP: If you have a router with four or more ports, the LAN ports will be marked 1 through 4 (or more). Connect an Ethernet cable to each of these ports and out to each of the individual computers, or Ethernet hubs, in your setup. Step 3: Configure the TCP/IP Control Panel On each of your computers, open your TCP/IP control panel and set it up as shown above. Close the panel and save the changes. Step 4: Configure Your Router via Your Web Browser NOTE: You need to complete the rest of the steps in this article on only one of your computers. Open your Web browser. It's best to use one of the newer versions of either Netscape Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. In the Location (Netscape) or Address (Internet Explorer) window, enter the IP address provided in your router's manual. In most cases, it will be the address shown above. Step 5: Access Your Router Settings To access the router settings, enter the name and password assigned in the user's manual. You will be able to change the default name and password once you are in the settings area, which appears after you complete fields in the above window. Step 6: Configure According to the Type of IP Address You Have You must configure your router differently depending on the type of IP address you have. When you called your ISP for your cable modem or DSL broadband service, you may have been given a choice of dynamic IP address (a new IP address is assigned to your computer each time you access the Internet) or static IP address (your computer hangs onto the same IP address, which is unchanged from one session to the next). If the person you spoke with did not give you this option and your service costs about $40, you can safely assume that you have dynamic IP. A static IP connection will often cost twice as much. If you're still confused, phone your ISP. If Your Router Uses Static IP Addresses If you have a static IP address, select the Specify an IP Address button and enter the information provided by your ISP here. If Your Router Uses Dynamic Addresses Scroll down to the PPPoE setup area in your browser window. Enable PPPoE and enter the user name and password information your ISP has provided you. Choose to enable or disable Connect on Demand. If Connect on Demand is disabled, your router will keep the last IP address assigned to it, even when your computer is off. When enabled, Connect on Demand will only request an IP when you are using an application that requires an Internet connection. If in doubt, choose to enable this option. Step 7: Keep Your Firmware Current Eventually, you should update the firmware on your router to enable the latest features and updates. The best way to do this is to download a TFTP (trivial file transfer program) client. You can download MacTFTP Client from http://www.mactechnologies.com/pages/download.html. Download the firmware update from the Web site of the company that made your router. Open the TFTP client and enter the information as shown above. Enter the address of the router, as in Step 2 when you accessed the control settings page through your Web browser. You must then tell the TFTP client which file to use to update the firmware. To do this, click on the File button and choose the firmware update file that you downloaded from the router manufacturer's Web site. After all fields have been filled, click on the Start button, and the client will update your router's firmware. Step 8: Restart Your Computer Restart your computer to make your new router settings take effect. You're all set! Now, all of the computers in your network should be able to connect to the Internet via your new router setup.",
